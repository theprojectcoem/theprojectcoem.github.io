One of his neighbors observed his frequent visits to the place and decided to find out what was going on. Soon he discovered the hidden treasure, and digging, he took the gold coin, stealing it from them. The avaricious man, on his next visit, found the gap empty and pulling his hair, he lamented bitterly. A neighbor, who heard his complaint, came to him and said, \"Thank you for not complaining so much. Go and get a stone and put it in the hole. Then imagine the gold is still there.
