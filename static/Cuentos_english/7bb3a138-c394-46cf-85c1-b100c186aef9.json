This animal would have survived the flood, without being collected in the ark. It was the size of a bull; it had a serpent's head, a spherical body covered with a green pelt, armed with arrows whose point was fatal. The feet were long, like those of a turtle; with the tail, like a snake, it could kill people and animals. When it rained, it rained hail that destroyed the crops. At night, the stalls were swarming. When the peasants were pursuing her, she hid in the waters of the Huisne which were rushing over, inundating the whole area. He preferred to devour innocent beings, women and children. He chose the most virtuous daughter, who they called the Corderita. One day, he seized a Corderita and dragged her out of the house naked and enraged into the Huisne. The victim\u2019s boyfriend cut the ear of the wig with an axe, which was her only vulnerable spot. The monster died immediately. They buried him and celebrated his death with drums, with choirs and dances. FIN Manual of fantastic zoology, 1957", "title": "La peluda", "author": "Jorge Luis Borges"}
