And the ass implored his companion, and said, I pray thee, my friend, help me to carry half of my load; for thee it would be as a game, but for me it would be a great service, for I feel that I am about to faint. But the horse refused to lend him help, laughing at the donkey. They continued walking until the donkey could not stand it any longer and fell unconscious. Seeing this, the horse realized how badly he had acted. And the master took off all the burden that was carried by the ass, and laid it upon him. You must help each other, because if your partner is missing, his burden will end up on your back. FIN", "title": "El asno y su mal compa\u00f1ero", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
