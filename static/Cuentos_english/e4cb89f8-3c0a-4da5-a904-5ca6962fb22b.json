I am going to die as a result of the wounds I received in an ambush by deserters from the Hessian Corps of Scavengers. I splash in my own blood every time I try to turn around looking for the impossible relief from the pain of my shrapnel-crushed bones. Before the blue glass of agony invades my arteries and confuses my words, I want to confess here my love, my disordered, secret, immense, delicious, drunken love for Countess Krystina Krasinska, my sister. May God forgive me the heavy fever watchings and wish I had to go through it, during our last summer in our parents' farmhouse in Katowicze. I've learned to keep quiet in every moment. I hope you'll consider me soon, when I appear before the Invincible Presence. And to think that she will pray for my soul beside her husband and children!
