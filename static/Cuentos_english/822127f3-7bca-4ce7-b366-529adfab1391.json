The plan is to flee to the other side of the border, but while they are away they spend the night in a ruined house abandoned on the road. At the light of the windows the nymphs play. Each one wears the clothes he has picked up. After each game, the Bizco snatches the winnings under the table: coins, watches, acorns, candles... Early in the morning the Bizco puts the winnings in a bag, the weight on his shoulders, and exhausted under that weight, his companions follow him, singing to the border. They pass through, arrive healthy and well to the Crucifixion where they have resolved to separate themselves and there they kill the Bizco. They had already won enough to carry the heavy button.
