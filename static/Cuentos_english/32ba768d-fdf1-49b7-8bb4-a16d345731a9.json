One day, when the farmer was about to leave his work and go home at dusk, he saw a pile of charcoal lit in the middle of the field. I came up very strange and saw a black devil sitting on top of it. - You're sitting on a treasure? - I'll ask the laborer. - Yes, \"said the devil. About a treasure in which there's more gold and silver than you've ever seen in your life. \"The treasure is in my field, and therefore it belongs to me\", said the Labrador. \"It will be yours\", replied the devil, \"if for two years you promise to give me half of what your field produces. I'm out of money, but I like the fruits of the earth. And the man of the field accepted the deal, and said, There shall be no strife in the division; thou shalt have what is on the ground, and I with what is underneath. He looked good to the devil, not knowing that the cunning laborer had planted seeds. When the harvest was ripe, the devil came and took away his share. He found only yellow leaves, but the farmer was happy and contented and stayed with the seeds. \"This time you have gained an advantage\", the devil protested, \"but next time you will not be able to do so. What grows above the ground shall be yours, and what grows beneath mine shall be mine. - All right, said the peasant. But when it was time to sow, he did not plant sprouts, as he did the first time, but wheat. When the grain was ripe, the man went to the field and reaped the stems straight from the ground. When the devil came, finding nothing but cracks, he ran furiously down a stove. \"That's how you hunt foxes\", said the farmer as he took the treasure.
