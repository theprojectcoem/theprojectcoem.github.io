All she had left were the clothes she wore and a piece of bread to give her a charitable soul. But the girl was good and godly. Being abandoned by the whole world, she leaves the country, trusting in God our Lord. He met a beggar, who said to him, \"Woe to you! Give me something to eat. I'm so hungry! I'm going to eat! And she stretched out the bread that she had in her hand, and said, God bless thee. And he went on. Farther away he found a boy who said to him, crying: \"I have a cold in my head. Give me something to cover myself with. The little girl took off her hat and gave it to him. And then I took a little girl out of the way who was not wearing a body and was cold. She'll give you hers. Then she asked for another skirt, and she gave it to her too. Finally, when it was dark, he arrived in a forest and was introduced to another crippled girl who asked for a shirt. The godly girl thought, 'It's dark night and no one will see me. I can get rid of the shirt, and he took off the shirt and offered it to the wretched woman. And when she was naked, stars fell from the sky, and behold, they were glittering gold ducks. And in exchange for the shirt he just gave, another one of fine thread fell on him. She then collected the duchies and was rich for life. \u266a Finish \u266a", "title": "Los ducados ca\u00eddos del cielo", "author": "Hermanos Grimm"}
