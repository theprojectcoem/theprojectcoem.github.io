He walked lightly and made great strides to get as quickly as possible to the city, where he was going to sell the milk he was carrying. Along the way, he began to think about what he would do with the money he would get in exchange for the milk. - I'll buy a hundred eggs. Or not, three chickens better. Yes, I'll buy three chickens! The girl kept going, making sure she didn't stumble as her imagination went further and further. - I'll raise chickens and have more and more, and even if the fox shows up around and kills some, I'm sure I have enough to buy a pig. I'll eat the pig and when it's beautiful I'll sell it back for a good price. Then he buys a cow, and his calf too... But suddenly the girl stumbled, the spider broke, and the calf, the cow, the pig, and the chickens went with him.
