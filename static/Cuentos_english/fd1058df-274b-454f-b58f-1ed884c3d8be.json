One of them said, \"That's Mrs. Ruth's house\". She's an old witch. \"You're wrong\", said the second man, \"Mrs. Ruth is a beautiful woman who lives there devoted to her dreams. \"Both are wrong\", said the third. Do\u00f1a Ruth is the landlord of this vast land and draws blood from her servants. And they continued their way arguing about Mrs. Ruth. When they reached the other side of the road, they met an elderly man and asked, \"Could you tell us about Ruth, the woman who lives in that white house on the hill?\" The old man lifted his head and smiled and said, \"I am ninety years old and I remember Mrs. Ruth from childhood. But Mrs. Ruth passed away 80 years ago. And now the house is empty. Owls nest in it sometimes, and people say the place is haunted.
