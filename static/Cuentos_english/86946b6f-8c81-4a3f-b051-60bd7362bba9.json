In it he discovers a young woman, very beautiful, with very dark hair, very pale complexion. Around his long neck, a thin black ribbon, with a knot. The student dances with her all night. At dawn, he takes her to his barn. When she begins to strip her, the young woman tells him, begging him not to take off the ribbon around her neck. He's got her completely naked in his arms with his little belt on. They love each other, and then they fall asleep.

And the young woman's head rolls down the ground. Finish Philosophical Tales, 1971", "title": "El amor", "author": "Costas Axelos"}
