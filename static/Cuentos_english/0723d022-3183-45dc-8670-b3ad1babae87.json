He replied that a man like him understood no riddles and that it was enough to have won by a shot. Some said the solution to the puzzle was fortune, others the earth, others the light. Zadig thought it was time. Nothing is longer, he added, because it is the measure of eternity; nothing is shorter because it never reaches the end of our projects; nothing is slower for the one who waits; nothing is faster for the one who enjoys it. He stretcheth out to the infinite, and to the infinite he is divided; all men neglect him, and mourn his loss; without him is nothing done; he maketh to forget all that is unworthy of posterity, and immortalizes great things.
