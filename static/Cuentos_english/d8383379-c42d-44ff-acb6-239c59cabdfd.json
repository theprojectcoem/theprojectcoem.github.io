Unable to hide his pleasure, he knocked on the door of the house, which was finally opened by a very, very old man, with a long white beard. The moment she started talking to him, he woke up. All the details of this dream remained so engraved in his memory, that for several days he could not think of anything else. Then he had the same dream again three nights in a row. And he always woke up the moment he was about to start his conversation with the old man. A few weeks later the young woman was driving to a weekend party. Suddenly, he pulled the driver's sleeve and asked him to stop the car. There, to the right of the paved road, was the peasant path of his dream. \"Wait a minute\", he begged, and walked down the path, his heart beating madly. She was no longer surprised when the pathway climbed upward curving to the top of the forested hill and left it in front of the house whose smallest details she now remembered so accurately. The same old man in the dream was responding to his impatient call. \"Tell me\", she said, \"is this house for sale? \"Yes\", replied the man, \"but I do not advise you to buy it. A ghost, my daughter, haunts this house! - A ghost, the girl repeated. Oh, my God, who is he? \"You\", said the old man, and softly closed the door.
