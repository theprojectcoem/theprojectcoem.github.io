But one day, these beings found the key to happiness, followed the path to the Divine and reabsorbed into Him. God was sad, alone again. He thought about it. He thought the time had come to create man, but he feared that he might discover the key to happiness, find the way to Him, and be left alone again. She kept thinking and wondered where she could hide the key to happiness so that the man wouldn't go with it. She had to hide her in a secluded place where man could not find her. First he thought of hiding it at the bottom of the sea, then in a cave in the Himalayas, then in a very remote outer space. But he wasn't satisfied with these places. He spent the whole night on watch, wondering where would be the safe place to hide the key to happiness. He thought that man would descend into the deepest ocean and that the key would not be secure. Nor would it be in a cave in the Himalayas, because sooner or later I would find those lands. It wouldn't even be well hidden in the vast sidereal spaces, because one day man would explore the entire universe. Where did you hide it? I kept wondering at dawn. And as the sun began to dissipate the morning mist, the Divine suddenly came to mind the one place where man would not seek the key to happiness: within man himself. He created man and placed the key to happiness inside him. FIN", "title": "La llave de la felicidad", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
