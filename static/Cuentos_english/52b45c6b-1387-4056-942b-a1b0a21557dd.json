It was at the entrance of autumn, when precautions are most necessary; as soon as it rains as the sun does, and the bright tape of Iris warns the insightful that in that season there is no more layer. Our man, therefore, expected rain, and provided himself with a strong and thick coat. \"You believe this one\", said Boer, \"who foresaw everything; but you didn't think that if I began to blow, the devil would go to his arrogant cloak. It'll be fun to see your troubles. You want us to try it? \"Let us bet, without spending so much saliva\", replied Jupiter, \"which of the two will soon pull that coat off the satisfied rider's shoulders\". You start, I'll let you darken my rays. No more insistence was needed, for Boer, on the spot, swung like a balloon and making a thousand devils' whistle, whistled, whistled, blew, and produced such a hurricane that everywhere it brought down houses and boats to the brink: no more than by a layer! The rider put all his might into keeping the wind from taking hold of her. And this saved him. Boer wasted his time: the more he tried, the better the knight, well-rolled with the hood, defended himself. When the wind-blower lost the ship, Phoebe dissipated the cloud, caressed and made the walker warm, who soon, sweating and trembling, stripped himself of the already annoying coat. For the thing that violence and fury cannot do, is done by gentleness and gentleness. FIN", "title": "Febo y B\u00f3reas", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
