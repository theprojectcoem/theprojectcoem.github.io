And they feared him for his power, and loved him for his wisdom. And there was in the heart of that city a well of water, clear and fresh, from which all the inhabitants drank, even the king and his courtiers; for it was the only well in the city. One night, when the city was quiet, a witch came and poured seven drops of a mysterious liquid into the well. She said, \"From now on, anyone who drinks this water will go crazy\". And it came to pass the next morning, that all the inhabitants of the kingdom, except the king and his great chamberlain, drank of the well, and went mad, as the witch had foretold. And on that day in the streets and in the marketplace the people cried out, \"The king is mad!\" Our king and his great chamberlain have gone mad. We cannot allow a mad king to rule us; we must overthrow him. That night, the king ordered that a large golden cup be filled with water from the well. And when it was taken, the sovereign greedily drank and passed the cup to his great chamberlain, so that he might drink too. And there was great joy in the distant city of Wirani, because the king and the great chamberlain had regained their reason. FIN", "title": "El rey sabio", "author": "Gibr\u00e1n Jalil Gibr\u00e1n"}
