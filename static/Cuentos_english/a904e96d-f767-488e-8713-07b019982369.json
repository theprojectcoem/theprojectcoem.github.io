You started like a kite, with one bull horn armoured, braided and blinded, in total start of a positivist philosopher. He never hits the target, but he's always satisfied with his strength. Then open your exhaust valves and blow to full steam. (Charged with over-armour, the zealous rhinoceroses enter a graceless and skillless tournament in the forest clear, where only the medieval quality of the encounter counts.) Already in captivity, the rhinoceros is a melancholy, rusty beast. Its many-piece body has been armed in prehistoric rubble, with leather sheets folded under pressure from geological levels. But at a special time in the morning, the rhino surprises us: From its tiny, dry spots, like water coming out of a rock crack, the great torrenting, powerful organ of life springs forth, repeating at the tip the horned motifs of the animal's head, with variations of orchids, azaga and alabaster. Let us then pay homage to the hardened and abstract beast, because it has given rise to a beautiful legend. Although it may seem impossible, this rudimentary athlete is the spiritual father of the poetic creature who develops, on the tapestries of the Lady, the theme of the chivalrous and gallant unicorn. Beaten by a prudent virgin, the carnal rhino is transfigured, abandons its thrust and bends, stands up and kneels. And the horn obtained from male aggression turns before the maiden a thin, swollen ivory. FIN", "title": "El rinoceronte", "author": "Juan Jos\u00e9 Arreola"}
