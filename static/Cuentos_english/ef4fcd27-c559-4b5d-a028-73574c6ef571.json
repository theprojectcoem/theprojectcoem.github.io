Absent everything, he lost his balance and fell into the sea. Some fishermen took him out with their nets and, by engaging in the divine incarnation, they too entered into ecstasy. Feeling very happy, drunk with spiritual joy, they quit their jobs and began to go about their lives without ceasing to call upon God's name. When the relatives noticed that the hours were passing and they were not coming out of their mystical trance, they began to worry. They then tried to get them out of ecstasy, but they failed in their attempts. Time passed and they were all still connected to Cosmic Consciousness, absent from everyday reality. Powerless and alarmed, the relatives asked Gauranga for advice, who advised them: \"Go to a priest's house, get some rice, put it in the fishermen's mouths and I assure them that you will recover from your ecstasy\". The relatives took the rice from a priest's house and put it in the fishermen's mouths. At that, the priest's rice took care of them from ecstasy and they all returned to their ordinary state of consciousness.
