He would bite them over and over again, then he would round me several times, without ceasing, and then he would resume his work. A gentleman, suddenly, passed by, took a look, and then asked me why I was suffering from the zopilote. - I'm lost, I said. When he came and started attacking me, I of course tried to make him go, until I tried to strangle him, but these animals are very strong... he almost threw himself in my face, but I preferred to sacrifice my feet. They're almost unmade now. - You know, let yourself be tortured like this! - the gentleman told me. One shot, and you're in the cockpit. - You're not serious? - I said. And you would do me a favor? \"I'd love to\", said the gentleman, \"I just have to go home for my gun. Could you wait another half hour? \"Who knows\", I said, and I stood for a moment, in pain. So I said, \"However, go see if you can... please\". \"All right\", said the gentleman, \"I'll try to do it as soon as I can. During the conversation, the pilot had been quietly listening, turning his eye slowly between me and the gentleman. Now I had realized that I had been understanding it all; he lifted his wing, made himself backward, to catch flight, and then, like a jabalinist, threw his beak through my mouth, deep inside me. Falling backwards, I was relieved to feel him drowned hopelessly in my blood, which was filling every hole in my body, flooding every shore. FIN", "title": "El zopilote", "author": "Franz Kafka"}
