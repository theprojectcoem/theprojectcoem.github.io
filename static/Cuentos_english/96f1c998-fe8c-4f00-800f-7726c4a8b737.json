But the man, having put his intelligence to work, when the winter came, built a house and dwelt in it. One day when the cold was very cold, and the rain began to fall, the horse could not stand it any longer, he ran to the man and asked him to give him coat. The man told her that he would do so on one condition: that she would give him a portion of the years that were due. The horse agreed. Soon after, the ox appeared, who could not bear the bad weather either. The man replied the same: that he would admit it if he gave him a certain number of his years. The ox gave up a piece and was admitted. Finally, the dog arrived, also dying of cold, and giving up part of his life, he got his refuge. And here is the result: when men meet the time that Zeus gave them, they are pure and good; when they reach the years of horse-calling, they are fearless and proud; when they are in the ox's age, they are dedicated to commanding; and when they come to use the dog's time, at the end of their existence, they become irascible and moody. There are four stages of man: childhood, youth, maturity and old age.", "title": "El caballo, el buey, el perro y el hombre", "author": "nan Esopo"}
