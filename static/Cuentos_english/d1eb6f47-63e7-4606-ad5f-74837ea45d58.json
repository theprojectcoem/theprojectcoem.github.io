Light up a cigarette. Read it a little. Turn off the light again. But he can't sleep. At three in the morning, he gets up. Wake up your friend next door and tell him you can't sleep. He's asking for advice. The friend advises you to take a little walk so you get a little tired. Get a cup of lime and turn off the light. He does all this but he can't sleep. He's getting up again. This time, go to the doctor. As always, the doctor talks a lot but the man doesn't sleep. At six in the morning, he's loaded a revolver and he's lifting his brains. The man is dead but he hasn't been able to sleep. Insomnia is a very persistent thing. FIN", "title": "En el insomnio", "author": "Virgilio Pi\u00f1era"}
