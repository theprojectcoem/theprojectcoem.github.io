God sentenced him to many thousands of centuries of purgatory because if men who do not kill, who acquit from the last sentence, condemn him almost as much as his thirty years, God, who forgives from Hell, condemns him sometimes to all eternity except one day, and even if that day kills all eternity completely, how old and how prostrate the soul will not be on the day when it fulfills its sentence! He'll be as dumb as the soul of the whore Elisa of Goncourt when he leaves the quiet prison. \"How many leaves of the calendar, how many Mondays, how many Sundays, how many firsts of the year waiting for a first of the year apart for so many years!\" thought the condemned, and unable to resist that, he asked God so abusively cruel, to banish him to hell for good, for there is no impatience there. Kill my hope! Kill that hope that thinks of the end date, the immensely distant date!, cried that man who was finally sent to Hell, where his despair was relieved.
