A wolf rushed over him, ready to give himself a feast, when the dog begged him not to slaughter him yet. \"Look at me, now I'm in my bones\", he said, \"wait a little while, for my masters will soon celebrate their wedding. Since I'll also give myself my good loads, I'll get fat and I'll certainly be a better delicacy to your liking. The wolf believed him and left. After a while he came back. But this time he found the dog sleeping in an elevated room of the house. He stopped in front and reminded the dog of what they had agreed. Then the dog said, \"Oh wolf, if you ever see me sleeping at the gate of the house again, don't worry about waiting for the wedding! If you save yourself from danger, you never repeat the mistake.", "title": "El lobo y el perro dormido", "author": "nan Esopo"}
