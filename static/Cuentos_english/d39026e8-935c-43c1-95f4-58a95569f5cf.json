I'm going to... I found writing where it says about the fountain blooming towards the sun. What are you looking for? \"I seek the mystery of death\", replied the first. They thought that the other was ignorant, and they began to argue and accuse each other of spiritual blindness. While the philosophers were arguing with the wind, a stranger passed by who was considered foolish in his own city. When he heard the men arguing, he stopped for a moment and listened to their arguments. Then he came to them and said, \"My good friends, you are both from the same school of philosophy and you are talking about the same thing, but you use different words. One of you is looking for the fountain of youth, and the other for the mystery of death. They are one and the same, and like one dwell in you both. And he said, \"Ever, wise men\". And he walked away laughing complacently. The two philosophers looked at each other in silence for a moment and then they laughed too.
