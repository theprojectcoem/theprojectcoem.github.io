He went to Don Favonio's house and said, \"Don Favonio, do you want to be my husband?\" Favonio was a guy who was attached to his money and didn't like women. And he said, Not long, but not a second, because thou hast not a penny for the dowry. Do\u00f1a Bores, touched in her weak spot, began to blow with all her might without stopping a minute, even at the risk of her lungs exploding. And the wind blew three days and three nights in succession, and heavy snow fell three days and three nights; and the fields and the mountains and the villages were covered with white. \"There you have my dowry\", he told Favonio. And you said I had nothing. Is that enough for you? And he went to rest from the fatigue produced by three days of uninterrupted blowing. Favonio said neither yes nor no; he shrugged his shoulders and began to blow. For three days and three nights the wind blew, and for three days and three nights the fields, the mountains, and the villages were hit by a heat wave that melted to the last cup of snow. Do\u00f1a Bores, after a restful sleep, woke up and saw that nothing was left of her dowry. Where did your dowry go, Miss Bores? Favonio mocked himself. You still want me to marry you? Donnie Boeres turned her back on him. No, Don Favonio, I would never want to be your wife, because one day you can turn my dowry into smoke.
