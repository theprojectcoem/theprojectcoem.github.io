He went and went, and came to a cottage where an old man was praying ardently. They stood together in front of the icons, and recited for a long time. After finishing his prayers, the old man told him to join him. They did so. Then they were dismissed and each one went his own way. When the peasant son returned, the father decided to marry him. - I don't want to marry, my father - he said. Let me serve God for the rest of my life. But the Father did not want to hear of it. He sought a bride, asked for the hand, and ordered his son to marry. The son reflected and left the house. He walked some time, and found the old man with whom he had lodged. The old man took him to his garden. The peasant boy thought he had been there for about three minutes. But when he returned to his people, he saw that everything had changed. He asked the priest where the old church was, and where the people who lived there before were. He especially prayed for the bride who was abandoned by her husband at the altar. The priest took the books from the church, looked at them, and said, \u201cThat was about three hundred years ago.\u201d Then he asked the son of the peasant: who was he, from where had he come? And when he had gathered everything together, he ordered his stewards to prepare themselves to serve the Mass: \u201cThis man,\u201d he said, \u201cis the brother of Christ.\u201d When the mass was about to end, the peasant boy\u2019s son began to lose size, until he disappeared at the moment the mass ended.
