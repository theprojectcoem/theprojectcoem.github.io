But that was precisely the stain of his love: in the absence of flight. I loved him with bourgeois, domestic, short-lived love. No adventures, no dangers, no risking for nothing. Judas, lacking courage or perhaps imagination, would have preferred a Jesus who was a carpenter, married a good-natured maiden, had children, ran on time to the synagogue, and occasionally paid a courtesy visit to Caiaphas. But Jesus escapes his hands, prophesying, performing miracles, speaking against authority, giving speeches. He will end up on the cross, Judas thinks in despair. What can I do to save him? Judas appeals to a heroic remedy: denounce him before it is too late and Jesus' transgressions become ever more serious. He is charged and arrested. According to the law, Jesus' crimes are worth only twenty lashes. What would poor Judas imagine that his plans would be derailed by the episode of Barabbas? When he sees that everything has gone to the devil and that Jesus is actually hanging from a tree, he commits suicide.
