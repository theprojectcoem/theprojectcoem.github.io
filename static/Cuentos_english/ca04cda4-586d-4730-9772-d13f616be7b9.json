Near his village, he met a man who asked him where he was going. \"To my land\", replied the Galician. - If God wills - replied the first. \"I must arrive, God willing or not\", replied the Galician, seeing from afar his village, in whose territory only a stream separated him. Not well said, when passing the stream fell on it and became frog. For three years he lived in this way, always fleeing the poor from the scoundrels, the squirrels and the storks, his fierce enemies. After three years, another Galician came by and asked him where he was going. He answered, \"My country\". \"If God wills\", cried a frog, which pulled its head out of the water. And when he had said it, the frog, who was the Galician first, suddenly found himself again man. He went on his more merry way than the Passover. When he found another traveler, who asked him where he was going, he said to him, \"Come to the land, if God so wills. See my wife, if God so wills. See my children, if God so wills. See my vineyard, if God so wills. Plant my field, if God so wills. Then God wills. Give me a good harvest\". And as to all things, God had added to them the godliness, and the desire of the Lord was fulfilled. And he found his wife and his children good, and the maidservant barren; and he sowed his field, and gathered up good harvest; for God was well pleased with him.
