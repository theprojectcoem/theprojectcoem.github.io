They came because they were afraid or because they didn't have it, because they were happy or unhappy, because they felt like the Pilgrims, or because they didn't feel like the Pilgrims. Each of them had a different reason. They left hateful women, hateful jobs or hateful cities; they came to find something, to leave something or get something; to dig something up, bury something or abandon something. They came with ridiculous dreams, with noble dreams or no dreams. The government finger pointed out from four-color signs in countless cities: There's work for you in heaven. Visit Mars! And men were launching into space. At first only a few, a few dozen, because almost everyone felt sick even before the rocket left Earth. They were sick of loneliness, because when you see your house shrink to the size of a fist, a cloud, a pinhead, and then disappear behind a fire trail, you feel like you've never been born, that there are no cities, that you're nowhere, and there's just space around, nothing familiar, just strange men. And when the states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, or Montana disappear into a sea of clouds and, even more so, when the United States is just a foggy island and the whole planet looks like a locked ball thrown away, then you feel truly alone, wandering the plains of space, looking for a world that is impossible to imagine. It was not uncommon, therefore, for the first emigrants to be few. Their numbers grew steadily to surpass the men already on Mars. The numbers were encouraging. But the first solitary ones did not have that consolation. FIN Taken from Martian Chronicles, 1950", "title": "Los colonizadores", "author": "Ray Bradbury"}
