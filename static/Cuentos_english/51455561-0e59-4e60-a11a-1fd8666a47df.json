The boy was eight years old and his father lived only for him. Upon hearing of the owner's departure, robbers took advantage of his absence to enter and steal everything in the house. They found the young man and took him with them, not without first burning the house. It's been a few days. The man returned home and found the house destroyed by the fire. Alarmed, he searched among the cremated remains and found some bones, which he deduced were those of his beloved son's burned body. With infinite tenderness, he put them in a sack that hung around his neck, next to his chest, convinced that they were his son's remains. A few days later, the boy managed to escape the wicked bandits and, after finding out where his father's new home was, ran to her and insistently knocked on the door. - Who is it? - asked the father. \"I am your son\", the boy replied. \"No, you can't be my son\", replied the man, hugging the sack that hung from his neck. My son is dead. - No, Father, I am your son. I managed to escape the bandits. - Go on, can you hear me? Go and do not disturb me, the man ordered, without opening the door and strapping the bag of bones against his chest. My son is with me. - Father, listen to me; it's me. - I said go! -He said, \"Well, I'm not going to do it\". My son died and he's with me. Get out of here! And he kept hugging the bone sac.
