All fruit was there: mangoes, chirimoyas, oranges, paltas1 or guavas and all fruit seen in the world. All kinds of animals were there, and they all got along well with each other and with our father. And so he needed only to stretch out his hand to get what he wanted. But the condition of every Christian is to be discontented. And there our father Aaron cried to the Lord. It is not certain that he would ask his wife first. He first asked him to leave the night. \u2014Lord, he said, \u201cLet the shadow go: do not make night; let it be only day. And the Lord said to him, \"Why? And our father said to him, \u2014Because I am afraid. I can't see or walk and I'm scared. And the Lord said to him, The night to sleep is come. And our father Adam said, \u201cIf I am quiet, I feel like an animal will attack me by exploiting the darkness. \u2014Ah! \u2014 the Lord said \u2014 that makes me see that you have bad thoughts.

But as our father also did not know how to do it, though he sat up all night, and then he went out to the animals. And that is how devils, demons and demons in chains are seen, and also lions and tigers and all kinds of beasts of the night. And most of the time they are merely shadowy, like the lion that taught our father the Lord. But the story was not yet over. It was that our father Adam, not knowing what to do, always had fear, as I have told you, and he asked the Lord for consolation. But then he said, \"You have said this to everyone, except me.\" And the Lord, as it was certain that all had, except him, had to give it.
