It was a father and his son. They longed to meet Ramakrishna to receive mystical instruction from this great sage. They were waiting in the garden for the master to receive them, when suddenly a snake appeared and bit the young sadhu. The father was very alarmed and began to tremble and shout for help. The son, however, remained very serene, impatient, as if not bitten by a dangerous snake. Really surprised, the father asked his son: \"But how can you be so calm? The young sadhu, very calmly, replied: \"What is the snake and who has it bit?\" FIN", "title": "Los dos sadhus", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
