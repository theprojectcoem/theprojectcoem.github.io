When he was at the table, he could barely hold his spoon, dropped the cup on the mantle, and even sometimes the babe escaped. His son's wife and his own son were very upset with him, until they finally left him in a corner of a room, where they carried his scarce food on an old clay plate. The old man often cried and looked sadly at the table. One day he fell to the ground, and his shield was broken that he could barely hold in his trembling hands. His daughter-in-law filled him with improprieties to which he dared not answer, and he lowered his head sighing. They bought him a wooden pie for a room, in which he was fed from there on. A few days later, her son and daughter-in-law saw their son, who was a few years old, very busy gathering some pieces of wood that was on the floor. - What are you doing? - I'm not here. - asked his father. \"A cake\", he replied, \"to feed Mom and Dad when they're old. The husband and wife looked at each other for a moment without saying a word. Then they began to weep, and they put the grandfather back at the table; and he always ate with them, being treated with the greatest kindness.
