What I propose is the following: you die by the only method of philosophical suicide. \u2014And what is it? \u2014Awaiting his death. Take an instant, forget your person, die, consider as transitory something called necessarily to extinguish. As soon as you acquire this state of mind, all things that affect you will fall into the category of intrascendent illusions, and you will want to continue your experiences of life by a mere intellectual curiosity, sure as you are that liberation awaits you. Then, with great surprise to yourself, you will begin to feel that life is dividing itself from you, beyond you and your own interests and demands. And as you have made in your inner blank slate, whatever happens to you will seem like gain and a good you had no idea of. In a few days the world will sing to you of such good fortune that it will no longer want you to die, and then your problem will be the opposite.
