Let your life, my son, appear in the midst of them as the call of an intense and pure light, and by dazzling them, make them clap. They are cruel, greedy, and envious, and their words are poisonous lies that demand blood. Stand in the midst of those tormented hearts, my son, and let your serene gaze rest upon them as the merciful peace of the night brings an end to the gloom of the day. See your face, my son, that they may understand the meaning of all things; that they may love you and so love one another. Come to take the place that awaits you in the infinite, my son. At dawn, open and lift up your heart like a flower; at evening, tilt your head and, in silence, end the day and the prayer. FIN", "title": "El ni\u00f1o \u00e1ngel", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
