Hardly a massage and a surface saliva lubrication are needed. The absorption is easily initiated and the rabbit is delivered in a non-patellate asphyxiation. The head and front legs disappear. But half a bite later, the anguish of a definitive overlap comes. With the help of the boa, the rabbit's last moments of life pass, which is propelled and disappears into the rib tunnel by ever-tender esters. The boa then realizes that she has taken on a package of serious responsibilities, and the digestive fight begins, the real fight against the rabbit. It attacks it from the periphery to the center, with abundant gastric juice secretions, embalming it in successive layers. Hair, skin, tissues and intestines are carefully treated and dissolved in the stomach lining. The skeleton is finally subjected to a process of fracturing and crushing, based on contractions and lateral blows. After several weeks, the victorious boa, which has survived a long series of poisonings, leaves the rabbit's last memories in the form of small, laboriously polished bone splinters.
