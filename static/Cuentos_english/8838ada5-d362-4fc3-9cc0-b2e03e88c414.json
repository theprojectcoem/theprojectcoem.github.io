The beetle asked the eagle to forgive his friend. But the eagle, despising the scarab's insignificance, devoured the hare in its presence. Since then, seeking revenge, the beetle has observed the places where the eagle laid its eggs, and rolling them, it threw them to the ground. Seeing the eagle thrown from place to place, she turned to Zeus for a safe place to lay her future cubs. Zeus offered to place them in his lap, but the beetle, seeing the escape tactic, made a ball of mud, flew and dropped it on Zeus' lap. Zeus then got up to shake that dirt, and he threw the eggs to the ground without realizing it. That's why, ever since, eagles don't lay eggs when the beetles fly out. Never despise what seems insignificant, for there is no being so weak as to be unable to reach you.", "title": "El \u00e1guila y el escarabajo", "author": "nan Esopo"}
