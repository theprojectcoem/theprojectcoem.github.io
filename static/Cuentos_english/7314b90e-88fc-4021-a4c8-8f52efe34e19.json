The storm was terrible: it was melancholy, strained, tense. They spent ten years together and married a girl they had just met at a summer beach. On the night of the wedding, he discovered that his wife was suffering from a cervical subluxation: the vertebrae contained nerve roots. Pablo, the melancholy, the stressed-out, the tartamud, had to learn to relieve her pain. He tied her up by the collar and the chin and, pulling a string through a pole in the ceiling, lifted her up to her knees. Every night he would create a symphony under his wife's feet. We are little pigs. With them the great abyss that had been obsessing him for ten years with Paul, since he first saw him under his father\u2019s feet, was filling up. He got used to handling the horn. Even the idea of a horde was fun. Seeing his wife as a pigeon gave him a lift. At last he lost melancholy, astringency, tartamud and the woman.
