But imagine also that in a certain region a child survives, the son of a hierarch of a newly extinct civilization. The child feeds on roots and sleeps in a cave. For a long time, stunned by the horror of the catastrophe, he only knows how to cry and cry for his father. Then their memories get dark, they break apart, they become arbitrary and changeable like a dream. His terror turns into a vague fear. He remembers, with unspeakable nostalgia, the orderly and sheltered world where his father smiled at him or warned him, or ascended (on a spacecraft) wrapped in fire and in fright until he was lost among the clouds. Then, lonely mad, he falls to his knees and improvises a prayer, a lament song. Meanwhile the earth turns green: vegetation sprouts again, plants are covered with flowers, trees are loaded with fruit. The boy, turned into a boy, begins to explore the region. One day he sees a bird. The other day he sees a wolf. Another day, unexpectedly, he finds himself confronted by a young woman his age who, like him, has survived the ravages of nuclear war. They look at each other, they hold each other's hands: they're safe from loneliness. They whisper their respective languages, with the remnants of which they form a new language. They call themselves Man and Woman. They have children. Several thousand years later a religion will have spread among the descendants of that Man and that Woman, with the father of Man as God and the memory of prewar civilization as a lost Paradise.
