As an entrance, the famous fish called the great Leviathan is served, which swallows at once a smaller fish, 300 leagues long. At the beginning God created them male and female. But, fearing that he would destroy the earth and fill the universe with its kind, he killed the female and left her for the feast of the Messiah. For this food shall be slaughtered the bull Behemoth, which is so thick that the hay of a thousand mountains is eaten every day; the female of this bull was slain at the beginning of the world, that such a prodigious species might not multiply, which could only have harmed other creatures; but they assure that the Eternal did not spare her, because the salted cow is not as good as the Leviathan.
