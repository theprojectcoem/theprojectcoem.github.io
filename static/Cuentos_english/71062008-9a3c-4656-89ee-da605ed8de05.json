It was about finding that talisman after which everything you wanted would be within your reach. The Touchstone could be found, the sage told him, among the pebbles of a beach. All I had to do was walk along the shore and pick up pebbles. If one of those stones felt warm to the touch, contrary to what happens with pebbles, he would have found the Touchstone. The man immediately went home and decided to devote an hour each day to the search for such treasure. And every morning at dawn, he picked up stones on the beach. When I grabbed a pebble that felt cold, I threw it into the sea. This practice continued hour after hour, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. Every pimple felt cold. Every pebble was immediately thrown into the sea. However, she was comforted by the thought that such a practice was healthy and pleasant. In fact, over the years, I had almost forgotten the reason for my morning walks along the beach, enjoying looking at the sea, watching the waves, listening to the gulls and picking and throwing pebbles became almost a fun game, a habit. But then, late one morning, it happened that he took a pebble that he felt warm, unlike the others. The man, whose conscience barely noticed the difference, threw him into the sea. He didn't even realize he had thrown the Touchstone. The treasure whose search had begun so many years ago.", "title": "La piedra de toque", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
