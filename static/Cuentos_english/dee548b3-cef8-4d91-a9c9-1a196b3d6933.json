In those schools, the squids were taught to enter the gills of the fish. You would need to have some knowledge of geography to better locate the big fishes, that are going around there snatching. The main thing would, of course, be the moral formation of the peasants. They would be taught that there is nothing more great or beautiful for a sinner than to sacrifice cheerfully; they would also be taught to have faith in the fishes, and to believe them when they say that they are already engaged in bringing them a beautiful reward. They would understand that the success they had hoped for would only be assured if they learned to obey. The pagans should beware of low passions, materialists, egoists or Marxists. If any fish shows such tendencies, its colleagues should immediately inform the fish. FIN", "title": "Si los tiburones fueran hombres II", "author": "Bertolt Brecht"}
