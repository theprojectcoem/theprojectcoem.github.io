He was made in Toledo, at the end of the 19th century; Luis Meli\u00e1n Lafinur gave it to my father, who brought it from Uruguay; Evaristo Carriego had it in his hands at some point. Whoever sees him has to play a game with him; it turns out that it is a long time since they have sought him; the hand is raised to grasp the pressure that he expects; the obedient and powerful leaf plays with precision in the vain. Another thing the bull wants. It is more than a structure made of metals; men thought and made it for a very specific purpose; it is, in some way eternal, the hammer that killed a man in Tacuaremb\u00f3 last night and the hammers that killed Caesar. He wants to kill, he wants to pour out blood. In a corner of the desktop, between pens and papers, the pen, with its simple tiger dream, sleeps interminably, and the hand is energized when it shivers because the metal is energized, the metal that presupposes in every contact with the murder for which men created it. Sometimes it gives me a fright. Too much endurance, too much faith, too doctrinaire or insensitive, and the years pass, useless. FIN", "title": "El pu\u00f1al", "author": "Jorge Luis Borges"}
