I'll tell you what you're supposed to do. And thou shalt go continually from city to city, and from village to village, and from village to village. When you find someone you consider the most stupid, you should hand him this cane. - Even if I do not recognize another king than my true self, sir, I shall have to do as you say to please you. I'll be on my way right away. The yogi took the cane the monarch had given him and broke rough. He traveled without rest, reaching his feet to all the roads of India. He went through many places and met many people, but he found no human being he considered the most stupid. After a few months, he returned to the king's palace. He heard that the monarch had fallen seriously ill and ran to his rooms. The doctors explained to the yogi that the king was on the verge of death and a fatal outcome was expected in minutes. The yogi approached the dying man's bed. With a broken but audible voice, the monarch lamented: \"How unfortunate I am, how unfortunate!
