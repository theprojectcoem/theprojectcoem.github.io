Luis Taboada, dying, calls his son: \u2013 Go \u2013 he says \u2013 to the Parish of San Jose, and say that the Holy Oils be sent to me; but that they be good, that they are for me. And the sailor. The naysayer who hounds the Lagartijo day and night asking for the alternative. He lost a grandmother of this to whom he had as his second mother. The steward took the alternative for the soul of his aunt, and the steward, as a sensible man, gave up the torero. The first bull to hit the new matador is the flag bearer bull, which brings death in the guts. The father helps him, prepares the bull: \u2013Tie now! \u2013 He groans. And the boy perspires; he knows he cannot, he gives himself up, and, resigned to everything, turns his eyes to the master: then the black robe, the black and gold Lagartijo costume, which recalls the recent lult, warns him: before he can run, he still has time \u2013 and a voice! \u2013 to say, playing with life and the word: \u2013Maestro, what is offered to your lady?
