He aspired to conquer inner liberation and knew that achieving it required great motivation and great effort. He began to wonder if a person would need more than one release and, tormented by this question, called his teacher. - Venerable yogis. There is one question that concerns me very much. It even steals my sleep. I know how much effort must be made to find liberation, but I wonder: Is it enough for a person to be liberated once or are more liberations necessary? The yogi just replied, \"Tomorrow, sir, I'll tell you at dawn. The monarch couldn't even reconcile the dream. I was eager to get the answer. The first rays of the sun lit up his kingdom. He joined in and started to dress up. He remembered that he had to be present at an execution that was to be carried out. For raping and killing several women, a man had been sentenced to hang. The judge had announced: \"This cruel and perverse man should be hanged for each of his crimes\". When the king came out of his chamber, the yogi was waiting for him. \"I look forward to hearing your answer\", said the king, \"not to see him again\". - You will know her, sir, if you allow me to accompany you to watch the execution. The monarch and the yogi attended the execution. The killer was hanged. Then the king turned to the yogis and asked, \"When will you answer my question?\" \"Right now, Your Majesty\", replied the yoghurt. That man who was just executed should have been hanged, according to the judge, once for each of his crimes. Can you hang him again? - Of course not, the monarch said. A hanged man cannot be hanged again. And the Yogi said, \"And a man who is freed, can he be freed again?\" FIN", "title": "Ma\u00f1ana te lo dir\u00e9", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
