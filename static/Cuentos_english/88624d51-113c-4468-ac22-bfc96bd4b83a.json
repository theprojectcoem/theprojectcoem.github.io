Many selfish people forget that happiness is in the selfless love we show others. This story is about two real friends. Everything belonging to one was also belonging to the other; they were appreciated, respected, and lived in perfect harmony. One night, one of my friends woke up shocked. He jumped out of bed, got dressed in a hurry, and headed to the other's house. When he arrived, he knocked loudly and everyone woke up. The servants opened the door to him, frightened, and he entered the residence. \"The owner of the house, standing there with a purse in his hand and a sword in his hand, said to him,' Friend, I know that you are not a man who runs out at night without a reason. If you came to my house, it's because something serious is happening to you. If you lost money in the game, here you are, take it... and if you had an altercation and you need help fighting those who are after you, together we will fight. You know you can count on me for anything. The visitor replied, \"I appreciate your generous offerings, but I'm not here for any of those reasons. I was sleeping peacefully when I dreamed that you were restless and sad, that anguish was over you and that you needed me by your side. The nightmare worried me, and that's why I came to your house at this hour. I couldn't be sure you were okay, and I had to check it out for myself. That's how a real friend acts. He does not expect his companion to come to him, but when he assumes that something is wrong, he runs to offer his help. Friendship is what it is: being attentive to each other's needs and trying to help solve them, being loyal and generous and sharing not only the joys but also the pains.
