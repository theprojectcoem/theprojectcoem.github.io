The Turtle said, \"If you don't get to this tree as soon as I do... - answered the Hare laughing. You're out of your mind. I don't know what you'll have to do before you start the race to win it. - Crazy or not, I keep the bet. They bet, and they put the bet by the tree, knowing what it was, it doesn't matter to us, nor who was the judge of the fight. Our Hare had to make no more than four jumps. I say four, referring to the desperate jumps she makes when the dogs are already following her closely, and she gives them very happy and her legs barely see the wilderness and the prairie devouring. He had plenty of time to relax, sleep, and sniff. He let the turtle walk on a canon. This one started out as hard as he could; he hurried slowly. The Hare, disdainful of an easy victory, had his opponent in short, and judged it important to his decency not to undertake the race until the last hour. She was quiet on the fresh grass, and she was attentive to anything but gambling. When he saw that the Turtle was already at the finish line, he broke off like a lightning bolt; but his legs were stuck for a moment in the bush and his breezes were no longer useful. His rival came first. - What do you think? - said the Turtle laughing. Was he right or wrong? What good is your agility to you being so arrogant? Win for me! What would happen if you took the house down like I did? The fastest runner doesn't get to the finish sooner. FIN", "title": "La Liebre y la Tortuga", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
