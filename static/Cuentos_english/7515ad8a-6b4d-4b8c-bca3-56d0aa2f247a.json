It's possible, but I can't figure out why. Could you guys explain this? As an advance, I'll clarify. Perhaps, it is a common practice. But I anticipate, at what? Our performance at the Philharmonic. Yes, that's already well founded. However, if I don't miss the memory, it's the first time we've seen each other. Have we signed a contract by mail? Not yet, but we can sign it right now. I'm sure you will. But I would like to know more about your proposal. You guys make up a musical ensemble? Not yet, but we'll train him. And what kind of repertoire? That'll be seen when we learn to play. Playing? Yeah, to play musical instruments, of course. The clumsiness of that individual was starting to get on my nerves. You mean they don't know yet? Sooner or later, what else? The future is ours anyway. Can't you see we're young? Oh, of course. However, may I suggest something? First learn to play, then play a little bit and then I'll see you. The future certainly belongs to them. And he didn't give us the advance, the very fascist one. We got out of there socially disadvantaged. On the wall was a sign announcing the performance of a certain Mozart. Who is it? He asked... but I can't remember which one of us, because I have a memory failure, especially before noon. Probably an old man. We stopped thinking about art and we dedicated ourselves to building a bomb. One of these days we'll put her in the Philharmonic. The fight for justice is first.
