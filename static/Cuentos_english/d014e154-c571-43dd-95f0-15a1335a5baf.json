Sure that he would seek revenge, Wu spent the night up, reading, in the light of the lamp, the sacred Book of Transformations. Suddenly a blowing wind came from the house, and a warrior appeared at the door, threatening him with his spear. Wu knocked him down with the book. When he leaned down to look at it, he saw that it was nothing more than a figure, cut on paper. He kept it between the leaves. Shortly after, two little evil spirits came in, black-faced and blade-bending. These too, when Wu knocked them down with the book, turned out to be paper figures. Wu kept them just like the first one. At midnight a woman came knocking at the door, weeping and groaning. - I'm Chang's wife, she said. My husband and my children came to attack you and you have locked them in your book. I beg you to release them. \"Neither your children nor your husband are in my book\", Wu replied. I only have these paper figures. \"Your souls are in those figures\", said the woman. If they have not returned by dawn, their bodies, lying in the house, will not be able to revive. - You fucking wizards! - Wu shouted. What mercy can you expect? I'm not going to let them go. I'm sorry, I'll return one of your children, but don't ask for more. She gave him one of the black-faced figures. The other day he learned that the magician and his eldest son had died that night.
