Not far from Esmirna, under the high peaks where the merchant guides his laden camels, which lift their long necks and walk briskly over a sacred land, I saw a florid rose; storks swung among the branches of the corpulent trees, and their wings, when the oblique rays of the sun reflected on them, shone with a brilliance like mother-of-pearl. He had a rose more beautiful than all the others, and the Lord sung to her his sweet song; but the rose remained wilted; neither a grain of rock was seen in its petals, as a drop of water; it sat down on great stones. - Here rests the greatest of the singers - said the rose-. I want to perfume her grave, spread my leaves on her when the storm blows. The singer of Israel has come to earth, on this earth that I have broken. I, rose of Homer's tomb, am too sacred to bloom for a poor rogue. And the rogue continued to sing until he died. The caravan came, with its animals and its slaves; his son found the dead bird, and buried it in the same grave as the great Homer; the rose trembled in the wind. It came night, the flower shut its chrysalis and dreamed: It was a magnificent day, with a radiant sun; a troop of foreigners, of Frenchmen, came near, going on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Homer. One of them was a singer from the North, from the land of the northern lights and the northern blizzards. He took the rose, packed it into the pages of a book, and brought it back to his far-off land. The rose shivered in its tight prison of the book, until the man, already in his homeland, opened it and exclaimed: \u201cIt is a rose from Homer\u2019s tomb!\u201d Such was the flower's dream, and when it awoke it trembled at the touch of the wind, and a splinter of rock fell from its branches onto the singer's grave. The sun was up, and the rose was more brilliant than ever; the day was hot, like the heat of Asia. They heard footsteps, they came near to foreigners, like those the flower saw in her dreams, and among them was a poet from the North who cut the rose and, kissing it, took it to the land of the northern lights and the northern twilight. Now the flower-caused corpse lies in his Iliad, and, as in a dream, he hears him open the book and say, \u201cHere is a rose from Homer\u2019s tomb!\u201d", "title": "Una rosa de la tumba de Homero", "author": "Hans Christian Andersen"}
