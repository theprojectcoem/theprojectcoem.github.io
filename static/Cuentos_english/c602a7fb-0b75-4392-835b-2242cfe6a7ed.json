In each candle shone a soul, and souls who did not fit in the burning candles hid in the dark corners and, from there, looked at the children and made them cartoonish. Every light that the sacristan killed was a burning soul that dissolved into smoke threads, and we all felt the smell of souls in every dying candle. Since then, the smell of wax brings back memories of the fears of that night. The abbot sang a response2 in front of a box full of bones, and, when the father's prayer was over, he began to weep. Four men were walking ahead, driving away the women in pain, and with one hand they were grabbing the coffin and with the other hand they were holding a lit candle. The procession ended in the ossuary of the atrium. The four men were carrying the coffin rubbing the ground, and the sloping wax sprayed wax on the bones. Behind me was a swarm of women shouting loudly, much more horrifying than a cry at a drowning funeral. And if women cried, men cried silently. At that procession everyone had to cry and everyone was crying. And she also wept Baltasara, a little girl raised by public charity, who appeared in a basket, next to a cruiser, who had neither father nor mother nor for whom to weep; but the epidemic of tears infected her, and she also groaned with all her might. On the way home, a neighbor asked the girl, \"Who are you crying for, Baltasara? \"Doesn't it seem a shame you don't have anyone to cry for, ma'am? \" she whimpered. Fin of Things, 1926. Caress: A caring word or gesture that is made to a person, sometimes with the intention of getting something out of him. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
