That's why he lived in secluded places, in dark bushes, without talking to anyone, always lonely and silent, always sad, he, who actually had a cheerful character and liked the company of others. He only dared to go out late at night and, if he heard footsteps, he quickly raised his spines and turned into a ball to hide his blush. Once someone found a hybrid sphere, that tremendous spinner. Instead of spraying it with water or throwing smoke - as the zoology books advise - he took a basket of pearls, a cluster of crystal grapes, precious stones, or perhaps fake ones, cascades, two or three lentils, several fireflies, a golden toe, native and mistletoe flowers, artificial butterflies, a coral, a feather and a button, and he embedded them in each of the hedgehog's needles, until he turned that unpleasant creature into a fabulous animal. Everyone came to see him. Depending on who looked at it, it looked like the crown of a Byzantine emperor, a fragment of the tail of the Roc Bird or, if the fireflies were lit, the torch of a misty gondola for the feast of Bucentaurus, or, if any envious person looked at it, a buffoon. The hedgehog heard the voices, the exclamations, the applause, and cried out of happiness. But he didn't dare move for fear that he would get that million-night-long outfit off. It stayed that way all summer. When the first frosts came, he was starving and thirsty. But it was still beautiful. FIN", "title": "La inmolaci\u00f3n por la belleza", "author": "Marco Denevi"}
