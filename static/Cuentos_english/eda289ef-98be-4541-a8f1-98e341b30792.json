For a number of years he had been living in a cage, and his owner was an old man with whom the animal was in company. One day, the old man invited a friend to his home to enjoy a tasty Kashmiri tea. The two men passed to the living room where, near the window and in their cage, the parrot was. The two men were drinking tea when the parrot began to scream, insistently and vehemently: \"Freedom, freedom, freedom! He kept asking for freedom. During the entire time the guest was in the house, the animal kept demanding freedom. So heartbreaking was his request that the guest felt very sorry and could not even finish tasting his cup. He was walking out the door and the parrot kept shouting, \"Freedom, freedom!\" Two days passed. The guest couldn't help but think compassionately of the parrot. He was so troubled by the animal's condition that he decided to release it. He's got a plan. He knew when the old man would leave his house to go shopping. I was going to take advantage of that absence and release the poor parrot. The next day, the guest stood near the old man's house and, as soon as he saw him leaving, ran to his house, opened the door with a slingshot and entered the living room, where the parrot kept shouting: \"Freedom, freedom!\" Who wouldn't have felt pity for the little animal? Soon, he approached the cage and opened the small doorway to it. Then the parrot, terrified, threw himself into the opposite side of the cage and clutched with his beak and nails to the bars of the cage, refusing to leave it. The parrot kept shouting: \"Freedom, freedom!\"", "title": "El loro que pide libertad", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
