The young man told her. I'm very hardworking. I can handle more than three men. I'll make you prosperous. I'm only asking for half of what we earn. They came to a country where the merchant was commissioned to deliver the tsar's daughter from evil. The old man handed him three woods and a cup of water, and told him what to do. At midnight, the Tsar's daughter rose from the coffin. The merchant threw a piece of wood at her, and she swallowed it. He threw the second wood at her, and she swallowed it too. He threw the third one, and he did the same. Now I'm going to eat you, the Tsar's daughter threatened. - Wait a minute. Let me drink some water, the merchant replied. His mouth was filled with water, and he sprayed the tsar's daughter. She trembled and was instantly cured. The young man married the tsar's daughter and returned home with many riches. \"Now we're going to share everything\", the old man said. The merchant's son took his money and began to divide it equally. Why are you just handing out the money? We have also brought the Tsar's daughter. We're gonna give it to her too. He took a sword and cut the young woman in two. The young man was deeply distressed and said, \"God help you!\" Why did you kill her? So you feel sorry for him? The old man noticed. He put the two parts together, blows a blow, and the princess stands up instantly, just like before. Here's your wife. \"Live with her as God commands\", said the old man, and she disappeared.
