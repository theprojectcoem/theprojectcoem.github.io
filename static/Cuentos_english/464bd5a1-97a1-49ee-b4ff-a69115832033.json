My song will be on your face like a blessing. When you are alone, he will come to your side and, sweetly, repeat his music in your ear. When you are among the multitude, you will remain enshrined in your solitude. My song will be a light in your eyes and will enter your heart to the borders of the unknown. It will be like the faithful star that shines in the sky, when the night hides your way. My song will be a light in your eyes and will draw your gaze into the secret heart of things. And when my voice changes with death, you will continue to hear my song in your resounding heart of life. FIN", "title": "Mi canci\u00f3n", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
