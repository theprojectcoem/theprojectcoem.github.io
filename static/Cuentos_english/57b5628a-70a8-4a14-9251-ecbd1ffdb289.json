With the first he made no one to inherit his inheritance. With the second He was created eternally human and child. With the third He created a forever Christ on the cross and left Him nailed to that cross which is in heaven and serves as a model to all others. Then he bowed to the sun and swam by the first rays he could catch. Today he lives with me in my village. It is a beautiful child when he laughs, and natural. The nose is cleaned on the right arm, shaved on the cheeks, takes flowers, likes them and forgets them. He throws stones at the pigs, steals fruit from the trees and cries and cries of the dogs. And because he knows that they don't like it, but everyone else does, he persuades the girls to go out in groups with the canteen on their heads and lifts their skirts.
