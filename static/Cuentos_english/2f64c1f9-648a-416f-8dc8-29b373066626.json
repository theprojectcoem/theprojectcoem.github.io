Only she, who with her fame had enshrouded the whole island of Barbuda, could have persuaded the Brujo to leave the forest and walk a mile to visit her. He took him to his room and explained: -I haven't seen Bondo for months. The canoe has to go to other islands, with another woman. I want to die. - Are you sure it will go far? - Yes. And what you want is to kill him from here, far away? - Yes. He took a piece of wax, fashioned a doll that represented Bondo, and hammered a nail through his eye. There was a groan in the room. It was Bondo, who had just been released from prison that afternoon and was just about to enter. He took a step, with his hands on his eyes trembling, and fell dead at the feet of Diana. - You told me you were far away! -The Warrior protested; and muttering a bitter insult as seed, he departed from the field. The road, which had been stifled at the end, was now opened up; the light, which had been stifled at the end, was now of the moon; the drums, which had murmured at the end, were now shouting from the front; and the seed of insult, which, when he had left the ranch, had been put into his mouth, was now a symphony in the forest: -Stupid, stupider still! You assured me that Bondo was far away and he was no longer there. To kill him so close, no Power was needed. Any black person would have helped you. You are stupid! You have made me invoke the Power in vain. Best of all, for your fault, the Power has shattered me and no longer serves me. To see if it still served him, he just came to his room, looked behind him - a nocturnal owl - turned on the lamp, molded wax into a doll that represented Diansola and slammed a hammer into his eye.
