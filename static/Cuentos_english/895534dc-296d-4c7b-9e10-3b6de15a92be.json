But there are times when his whisper comes to me, like an icy breeze of ultratraumba, weakened after crossing the gulfs that separate the worlds, and that has emerged over the last horizons of deserts surrounded by ice. And he speaks to me in a language I've never heard, but I've always known; and he speaks to me of deadly things and wonderful things, beyond the reach of the static desires of love. His account is not of anything good or bad, nor of anything that can be desired or conceived or thought by the earth's termites; and the air that he breathes, and the earth through which he wanders, would burst forth like the cutting cold of outer space; and his eyes would blind the sight of men as if they were the sun; and his kiss, if it could be reached, would twist with a knife like the kiss of lightning. But upon hearing his distant and infrequent whisper, I imagine a vision of vast auroras, over continents larger than the world, and seas too vast for the quills of human enterprises. And sometimes it stutters the strange bonds it brings us, although no one will welcome them, and no one will believe them or listen to them. And at some dawn of desperate years, I will advance and follow wherever it calls me, to seek the blessed swim of its snowy distances, to perish among its inscrutable horizons.
