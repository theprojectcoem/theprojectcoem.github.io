He offered the doctor riches if he obeyed, and prison if he challenged him. After a year in prison, Hunain was again escorted to the throne of the califa. On one side of the throne were treasures, on the other, instruments of torture. The calf pointed first one of the mountains, then the other. \u2014What do you choose? \u2014he asked. Hunain replied: \u2014I have only learned the art of healing and no other. The calf pointed to the worm, and Hunain, seeing the hour of his departure, said, 'The day of judgment God will reward me.' If the calf wants to bite, it is his business. The calf's smile broke the tension. I never had intended to hurt the doctor. I just wanted to prove your honor.
