In a certain region of the East a child survived, the son of a spacecraft pilot. The boy ate herbs and slept in a cave. For a long time, stunned by the horror of the disaster, he could only cry and cry for his father. Then his memories became dark, disintegrated, became arbitrary and changeable like a dream; his horror turned into a vague fear. He would recall his father's figure, smiling or warning him, or climbing onto his spaceship, enveloped in fire and noise, and lost in the clouds. Then, lonely and crazy, he fell to his knees and begged him to come back. Meanwhile the earth was again covered with vegetation; plants were loaded with flowers; trees, with fruit. The boy, turned into a boy, began to explore the country. One day, he saw a bird. The other day he saw a wolf. Another day, unexpectedly, he was confronted by a young woman his age who, like him, had survived the ravages of atomic war. - What's your name? - I'm... - he asked her. \"Eva\", the young woman replied. What about you? - Adam, you know. FIN", "title": "G\u00e9nesis", "author": "Marco Denevi"}
