They met a very young and beautiful woman who also wanted to cross, but was afraid. So a monk took her up on her shoulders and carried her to the other shore. The other monk was furious. He didn't say anything but he was boiling inside. That was forbidden. A Buddhist monk was not supposed to touch a woman and this monk had not only touched her, but carried her on his shoulders. They traveled several leagues. When they arrived at the monastery, as they entered, the angry monk turned to the other and said, \"I have to tell the teacher\". I'll have to report this. It's not allowed. - What are you talking about? What's forbidden? - the other one told him. - Have you forgotten? You carried this beautiful woman on your shoulders, said the angry one. The other monk laughed and then said, \"Yes, I took it\". But I left it in the river, many leagues back. You're still carrying it.", "title": "El monje furioso", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
