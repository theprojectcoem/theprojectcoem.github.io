The boy who had no fat dogs didn't want to look at the blank shot, nor the noria, nor, above all, the uncle of the yellow, fleshy and green horses, hanging on gold bars. The boy who didn't have fat dogs, when he looked with his eyelid, said, \"That's nonsense that doesn't lead anywhere. It just goes back and forth and it doesn't lead anywhere. One rainy day, the boy found a round sheet of leaflet on the floor; the best sheet of the best beer bottle he'd ever seen. The plate was so bright that the boy took it and ran to the coffin to buy all the spins. And though it was raining and the man was covered with a canvas, silently and quietly he rode on a golden horse with big wings. And the tiovivo started to go around, around, and the music started screaming among the people, like he never saw before. But that little boy was so big, so big, he never finished his lap, and the faces of the fair, and the stalls, and the rain, went away from him. \"How beautiful it is to go nowhere\", thought the boy, who had never been so happy.
