He put his arms in the water to cool his face and there, in the water, he suddenly saw the image of death. He stood up very scared and asked, \"But... what do you want?\" I'm young! Why are you coming to get me without warning? \"I'm not coming for you\", replied the voice of death. Calm down and go home, because I'm waiting for someone else. I won't come looking for you without warning you, I promise. The young man entered his house very happy. He became a man, married, had children, followed the course of his quiet life. One summer's day, by the same river, he stopped again to cool himself. And he saw the face of death again. He said hello and wanted to get up. But a force kept him on his knees by the water. He was scared and asked, \"But what do you want?\" \"You are the one I want\", replied the voice of death. I came to get you today. - You promised me you wouldn't come after me without warning me! You didn't keep your promise! - I warned you! - You warned me? - A thousand ways. Every time you looked in a mirror, you saw your wrinkles appear, your hair turned white.
