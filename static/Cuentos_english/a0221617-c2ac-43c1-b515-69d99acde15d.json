The man advised her to enter his cabin. Almost immediately the hunters came and asked the woodcutter if he had seen the fox. The carpenter told them not with his voice, but with his hand he was pointing in disguise at the cabin where he had hidden himself. The hunters did not understand the hand gestures and relied solely on what was said with the word. The bitch, seeing them leave, left without saying a word. The woodcutter rebuked the fox for not giving thanks, even though he had saved her. And the fox said, If thy hands and thy mouth had said the same thing, I would have blessed thee. Do not deny by your actions what you preach with your words.", "title": "La zorra y el le\u00f1ador", "author": "nan Esopo"}
