One evening, as he was returning home earlier than usual, a faithful servant came to him and said, \"Your wife, our lady, is acting suspiciously. She's in her quarters with a huge chest, which belonged to your grandmother, big enough to hide a man. Maybe there'd be only some old embroidery on it. I think there must be a lot more to it now. She won't let me, your oldest servant, find out what's in it. Nuri went to his wife's room, and found her sitting, disconsolated, next to the huge wooden box. You wanna show me what's in the safe? He asked. Is it because of the suspicion of a servant, or because you do not trust me? Wouldn't it be easier to open it without thinking of any insinuations? \"Nuri asked. I don't think that's possible. Is it closed? - Yes, I did. Where's the key? She showed it. Dismiss the servant and I will give it to you. The servant was fired. The woman handed over the key and withdrew, obviously disturbed. Nuri Bey thought for a long time. Then he called four of his gardeners. Together they carried the coffin, at night, unopened, to a distant place on the estate and buried it. The matter was never mentioned again.
