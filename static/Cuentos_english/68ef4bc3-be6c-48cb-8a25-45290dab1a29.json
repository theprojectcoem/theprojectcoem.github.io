I walk around Buenos Aires and I stop, perhaps mechanically, to look at the arch of a swan and the slammed door; I get news of Borges by mail and I see his name on a list of teachers or in a biographical dictionary. I like beach watches, maps, 17th-century typography, etymology, coffee and Stevenson prose; the other shares those preferences, but in a quaint way that makes them into the attributes of an actor. It would be exaggerating to say that our relationship is hostile; I live, I let myself live so that Borges could write his literature, and that literature justifies me. It does not bother me at all to admit that he has got some valid pages, but those pages cannot save me, perhaps because the good is no longer of anyone, or even of the other, but of language or tradition. Besides, I am definitely going to lose myself, and only a moment of me can survive on the other side. I am gradually giving him everything, although I am conscious of his perverse habit of flattery and magnifying. Spinoza understood that all things want to persist in their being; stone forever wants to be stone and tiger a tiger. I have to stay with Borges, not with me (if there is someone there), but I recognize myself less in his books than in many others or in the laborious strum of a guitar. For years I tried to get rid of him and went from the mythologies of the arrow to the games with time and with the infinite, but those games are Borges now and I will have to think of other things. So my life is a fug and everything I lose and everything is of forgetting, or the other. I don't know which of the two is writing this page.
