And tell me that no one is in doubt; that before he dies I take no harm. And now, I beg you to advise me on this. \"Lord Count Lucanor\", said the patron, \"for this council I would like you to know what happened to one blind man with another. And the Count asked him how that had been. \"My lord\", said the patron, \"a man lived in a village and lost his sight and became blind. A blind man from that village came to him and told him to go to another village nearby and pray for him. The blind man said that he knew that on the way to the village there were wells and ravines and very strong passages, and that he had been much rebuked from that way. And the other blind man told him not to doubt because he would go with him and save him. And so he assured him and showed him so many pros on the way, that the blind man believed the other blind man and went away. And when they came to the strong and dangerous places, the blind man who led the other fell, and the blind man who was leading the way did not cease to fall. And you, my lord, if your suspicion is right and the fact is dangerous, do not put yourself in danger by what your relative and friend tells you, that he will die before you are hurt; for it would be of little benefit to you if he died and you were hurt and you died. And the count took this one for good advice and made it so and found it good in it. And don Juan, realizing that this example was good, made him write in this book and made these verses that say like this: Never get involved in any wrongdoing even if your friend makes you safe.", "title": "Cuento XXXIV \u2013 El conde Lucanor \u2013 Los dos ciegos", "author": "nan Juan Manuel"}
