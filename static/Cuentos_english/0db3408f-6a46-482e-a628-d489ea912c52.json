We can translate ictiocentaur by centaur-peeches; the word was applied to beings that the mitologs have also called centaur tritones. His representation is abundant in Roman and Hellenistic sculpture. From the waist up are men, from the waist down are fish and have front legs of horse or lion. Its place is in the throne of the sea gods, next to the hippocamps. FIN", "title": "Ictiocentauros", "author": "Jorge Luis Borges"}
