The poet was elusive and the peasant shy, but they talked. \"Let me tell you a little story I heard recently\", said the peasant. A mouse was caught in a trap. And as he was happy eating the cheese that was there, a cat stopped beside him. The mouse trembled for a moment, but he knew he was safe in the trap. - Are you eating your last meal, buddy? - said the cat. \"Yes\", replied the mouse, \"I have a life, therefore a death.
