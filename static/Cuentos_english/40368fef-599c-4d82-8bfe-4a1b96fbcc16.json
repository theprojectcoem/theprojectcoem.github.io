It is understandable, and you will see why: In the village of Ardes-sur-Couze, in the Puy-de-D\u00f4me, they decided one day to build a bridge over a river to go effortlessly to a venerable church. The bridge was built of stone, of a single arch, and so narrow and arched that, when entering it from one end, it could not be seen if anyone was walking in the opposite direction. So from the first day on, two fat goats came face to face. Neither of them wanted to give in, so they fought to pass and eventually both fell into the water. The next day, it was the turn of two donkeys. The same refusal to give way, the same dispute and the same fall into the river. Under these conditions, they decided to ban animals from crossing the bridge. But on the third day, two nearby peasants came face to face. They didn't do it any better than the goats or donkeys and their quarrel ended in the Couze... so they invented a saying: I told you there was someone who would get angry when they read this story!
