His wife, united to him by an unusual love in these times, usually keeps these used skins of her husband and fills them with fleshy foam rubber, to make a fairly presentable doll, well sewn and armed, with his uniform on. She's got about 15 in the garage, all police officers, so much like her husband that it's nice to see them all together, so dignified, so upright, so unreachable by corruption. The lady had a stereo set up in the garage and when the captain is on duty outside the house, the wife comes down to let her ex-husbands hear the best pages of world lyric. Absent, as enchanted, the fifteen policemen hear motionless the death of Desd\u00e9mona, the deserved murder of Scarpia, the fatal dispute between Carmen and Don Jos\u00e9, all crimes that demand the immediate arrest of the culprit, acts of blood and violence as they have seen so many times throughout their career. Since police leather dolls are produced at a rate of one per year and each one is older than the previous one, they have this unusual feature: the youngest of the fifteen is the oldest of the fifteen.
