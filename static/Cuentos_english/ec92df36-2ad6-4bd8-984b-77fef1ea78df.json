It was a great honor, because that poet was big, and our town, small. So there were many speeches and an orchestra to welcome him, and then an official meal in a room decorated with flowers. During the meal, the winner felt the need to get away from the bathroom and left. But as it had been a long time and he was not returning, the mayor finally went in person to see if the winner was feeling unwell. In the hallway he met the cleaning lady and the poet. I'm not letting him in! The cleaner's lady called the mayor. That he has no money to pay. But grandma, if he has the Nobel! That's what he just told me. If not, I would have let him go even without paying, even if it was just out of pity, that he's an older man... but as he goes and confesses to me that he has that disease, I don't leave him for anything in the world anymore! So I can infect all my clients! If you have the Nobel, let him treat you and not come to decent baths. There was no one who could handle the maid and the winner had to get out of the corner. He said he didn't care, but I'm sure he was offended. After she left, the cleaning lady was fired. Now in the toilet works a young man with a college degree, someone educated who knows what a Nobel is. But let me know if another Nobel will ever come to town.
