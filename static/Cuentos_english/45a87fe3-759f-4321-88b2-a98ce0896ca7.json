As if he had read knightly novels, because he was very literate, he ended up losing his mind. She was called Dulcinea the Toboso, and she commanded people to kneel and kiss her hand in her presence. She thought she was young and beautiful but she was thirty years old and had smallpox in her face. A gallan was invented and named Don Quixote of the Manch. She said that Don Quixote had gone to distant kingdoms in search of spears and adventures, in the manner of Amadis of Gaul and Tirant the White, to make merits before marrying her. She spent all day staring out the window waiting for her lover to return. A local hidalgo, Alonso Quijano, who despite smallpox was caught in Aldonza, came up with the idea of passing for don Quijote. He put on an old armor, rode on his rocket and went out to the streets to repeat the feats of the imaginary Don Quixote. When, trusting in his ardidity, he went to Toboso and presented himself before Dulcinea, Aldonza Lorenzo had died. FIN 1984", "title": "Dulcinea del Toboso", "author": "Marco Denevi"}
