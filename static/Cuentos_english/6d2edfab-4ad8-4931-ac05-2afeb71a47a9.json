The details of the street without life that many walk through are striking in their mental disorientation: the empty bottles in the car, the sacks at the door of the other's storeroom, and, in the distant gloom of the ultramarine shop on the corner, the glow of the bottles of that Oporto wine that I dream of that no one can buy. The people who pass by the street are always the same as what passed by a few minutes ago, it is always the fluctuating appearance of someone, stains without movement, voices of uncertainty, things that happen and do not happen. And suddenly, behind me in the office, the metaphysically abrupt scream of the mouse. I know I could kill him for interrupting what I wasn't thinking. I look at him, turning back, with a silence full of rage, I anticipate \u2014 with a latent tension of murder \u2014 the voice that will come to tell me something. She smiles from the bottom of the house and gives me good afternoons in a high voice. I adore you like the universe. FIN", "title": "Intromisi\u00f3n", "author": "Fernando Pessoa"}
