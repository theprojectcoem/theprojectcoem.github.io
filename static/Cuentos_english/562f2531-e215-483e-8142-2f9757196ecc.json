This one had to go back to his country with a stick leg. At first, he was a little proud. He entered the village church hitting the tiles so hard, he could have been taken by a cathedral sacristan. Then, after the curiosity had calmed down, he long regretted, ashamed, and thought that nothing good could be expected. He persistently sought, often as a hallucinator, the way to be useful. And now I'm there, on the path of humble well-being. Without even contempt for his fleshy leg, he feels some weakness for the wooden one. He works for a newspaper. You get a piece of land, and you can leave and be alone. Carries the right pocket full of red or white beans, of your choice. Besides, the pocket is broken; not too much, but not too much. With normal stakes, Fabricio travels the whole length and width of the terrain. His stick leg, every step, opens a hole. He shakes his broken pocket. Some of the beans fall off. He covers them with the help of his left foot and moves on. And as long as he earn his living honestly, the old warrior, with his hands on his back and his head upright, seems to be walking to recover his health.
