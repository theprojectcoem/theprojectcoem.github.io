To escape the wolf, the piglets decided to build a house. The little guy made it straw, so he could finish early and go play. The middle man built a little wooden house. Seeing that his little brother was done already, he hurried to go play with him. The eldest worked patiently in his brick house. \"You'll see what the wolf does to his houses\", he laughed at his brothers as they were having a great time. The wolf went out after the little pig and he ran to his straw house, but the wolf blew and blew and the straw house collapsed. The wolf chased the piglet through the forest, which ran to take refuge in his middle brother's house. But the wolf blew and blew and the wooden house fell down. The two piggies came out of there, spitting. With almost no breath, the wolf stuck to their heels, they arrived at the older brother's house. The three of them went inside and closed all the doors and windows. The wolf blew and blew, but he couldn't bring down the strong brick house. Then he went around the house looking for a way in. With a very long ladder he climbed to the roof, to sneak out of the chimney. But the older piglet put a pot of water in the fire. The wolf came down the chimney, but fell on the boiling water and burned. He escaped from there with a terrible scream that was heard all over the forest. He's never wanted to eat piggy.", "title": "Los tres cerditos", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
