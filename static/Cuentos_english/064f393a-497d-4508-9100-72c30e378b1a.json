Then God appeared before him and, as a reward, promised to announce him three times before he took him out of this world. The parish was very happy. He began to live in luxury and feasts; he ate and drank, taking advantage of the church's allowance. And he stopped thinking about death. He had been a sailor for several years, and his body was beginning to no longer be able to support the life he was leading: his arms were swollen, his back was aching, and he had to carry a sling. Later, he lost his sight and then his hearing. Jowled, blind and sordid, he continued to live with the decrepitude and the luxury of the past. Finally God stood before him to take him. Dismayed, the priest reproached God for not giving him the promised warnings. The Lord said to him, \u201cIt was I who struck you on the shoulder and on the side, until you had to double over! I put my hand on your eyes, until you were blind! And I shook your ears so you would be sore! So I have kept my promise. Now, follow me! The priest began to ask humbly for his pardon. He was sure he had not understood the meaning of his warnings, and was not prepared to die. The Lord looked with pity on the repentant sinner and said, \"Go, go. I don't want to be more just than merciful with you. FIN", "title": "Dios y el p\u00e1rroco", "author": "Aleksandr Nikoalevich Afanasiev"}
