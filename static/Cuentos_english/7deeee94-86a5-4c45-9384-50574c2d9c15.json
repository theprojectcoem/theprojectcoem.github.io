Because, in fact, he was fine. Except the cat was lazy and didn't want to do anything. Then, some millennia later, God created man. Only for the purpose of serving the cat, to give the cat a slave forever. To the cat, God had given indolence and lucidity; to man, he had given neurosis, manual skill and love of work. The man was fully committed to that. For centuries he built an entire civilization based on inventiveness, production and intensive consumption. A civilization that, in short, hid a single secret purpose: to give the cat shelter and well-being. That is, man invented millions of useless, and usually absurd, objects just to produce the countless items indispensable to the cat's comfort: the radiator, the pillow, the milk bowl, the saw blade, the tapestry, the rug, the sleeping basket and perhaps even the radio, because cats love music so much. But men don't know this. Because they want it that way. Because they think they're the blessed, the privileged. Things are so perfect in the cat world.
