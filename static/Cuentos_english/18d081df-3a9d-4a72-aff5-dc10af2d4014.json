Let me understand then that releasing what we have in our hand, in the hope of catching better prey, is a great unforeseen occurrence. The Fisherman was right, the Little Fish was right, each defending himself as best he can. Now I'm going to reinforce what I held back then with some new example. A certain Wolf, as clumsy as a rope was that Fisherman, finding Dog far from town, threw himself at him. The dog said, \"Consider your mercy\", he said, \"my miserable condition; wait a little while to take it from me: my master is going to marry his only daughter, and of course, since I am a bride, I must gain weight, though I do not want to. Give him credit for the Wolf and he let him go. He returned a few days later to see if his dog was already in good health; but the dog was already in the house, and through a gate he said to him: \"I am going out, my friend: wait for us; right now the doorman and I will be there\". The doorman was a huge dog, who would dispatch the wolves in a week. The robber stopped for a moment, and then saying hello to the doorman, he ran. He was light on his legs and also with helmets. He hadn't yet learned his Wolf craft well. FIN", "title": "El Lobo y el Perro Flaco", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
