The hyenas said, \"How are you doing today, sir?\" \"Very bad\", replied the crocodile. Sometimes, in my pain and sadness, I cry. And then the creatures say, \"They're crocodile tears\". And that hurts me a lot more than I could tell. And the hyenas said, Thou speakest of thy sorrow and of thy sorrow; but think a moment of me. I look at the beauty of the world, its wonders and its miracles and, full of joy, I laugh, as laugh the days. And the forest dwellers say, \"It's nothing but a hyenas laugh\".
