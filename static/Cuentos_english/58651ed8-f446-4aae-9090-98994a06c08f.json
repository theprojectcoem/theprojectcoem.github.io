Several times at night he changed his mistress, choosing him from men, women, children, eunuchs, slaves and animals, and with each mistress he modified the procedures of his depravity. He was finally given the chance to practice lesbianism with Hercules. The least one who could be expected to cope with this infamy was Hercules, a very masculine and even a little savage subject, who only enjoyed physical exercise, hunting and war, and who used to speak plagues of women. However, he agreed, first among laughter, as if celebrating a joke. Incredible and mysterious is what happened after that. Hercules was shaved, scented, dyed his eyelids with blue tuat from Egypt, his cheeks with purple water from Sidon, his lips with carmine paste from Shifaz, put on a blonde wig with loops, dressed him in a scarlet peplum that distinguishes prostitutes, loaded him with jewels, and put a rueca in his hands. Meanwhile, Onfalia lay naked on a couch in a room next door, between torches held by equally naked black slaves and peppers where the aphrodisiac scents of myrrh, algae and mustard burned. An orchestra of flute players and sitar-tankers performed such voluptuous melodies that black slaves, unable to restrain themselves, poured mandragora seeds on the floor before the complacent gaze of the queen, who was pecking at a cluster of satyr-filled grapes and shaking with abominable desires. Once he was disguised, Hercules approached a mirror and looked at himself.
