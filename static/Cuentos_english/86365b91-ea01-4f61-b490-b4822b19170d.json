They have no voice and communicate by facial gestures. Their huge heads, like barricades, are not easy to forget: on each side, over two inches wide, are their rose-colored eyes that glow in the darkness, and, passing through them from top to bottom, the mouth of huge yellow snouts that opens vertically and not in a clockwise direction. Their main food is the livids, repulsive beings that die on contact with light and live in the caves of Zin, where they play with their long legs like cannibals. The livids are the size of a small horse and their face looks quite human, despite the absence of nose, front and other important details. FIN", "title": "Gugos y l\u00edvidos", "author": "H. P.
