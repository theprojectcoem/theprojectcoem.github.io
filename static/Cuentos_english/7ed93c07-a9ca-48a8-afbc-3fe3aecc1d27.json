She felt such deep sorrow, especially for the loss of her two sons, that she even blamed God. She was so engrossed in sad thoughts when she felt the sound of the Mass. Admiring that the night had passed so early, she lit her light and headed for the church. When he arrived, he found the ship lit not by candles as usual, but by a strange light and a doubtful glow. The church was full of people; all the places were busy and when the old woman wanted to sit on the usual bench, she found it crowded. Looking at the people sitting in it, he recognized his dead relatives, wearing old spell-wearing suits but with pale faces. They did not speak or sing, only a deafening murmur and a slight noise could be heard throughout the church. And one of her dead aunts came to her, and said, Look toward the altar, and behold thy sons. The poor mother saw her two children, one on the wheel and the other on the wheel. And his mother said to him, See what thy children would be, if God had left them in the world, and had not called them when they were yet in the age of innocence. The woman came trembling to her house and fell on her knees and gave thanks to God for doing more for her than she could possibly imagine. He fell to bed and died three days later. \u266a Finish \u266a", "title": "La madre vieja", "author": "Hermanos Grimm"}
