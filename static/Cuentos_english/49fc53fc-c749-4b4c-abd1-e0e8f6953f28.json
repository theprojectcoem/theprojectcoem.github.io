They wanted to have some fun and have a good day in the country. They prepared some food, gathered at the exit of the village at dawn and embarked on the excursion. They walked happily through the fields chatting non-stop among big laughs. They came to a river and took a barge tied to a tree to cross it. They were feeling very happy, joking and spitting in the water. They came to the opposite shore and came down from the barge. It was a great day! On land, they counted and found there were only nine. But where was the tenth of them? They started looking for the tenth man. They couldn't find him. They began to worry and to mourn their loss. Did he drown? What happened to him? They tried to calm down and then they counted again. They only counted nine. The situation was distressing. One of them had definitely gone astray. They began to murmur and complain. Then a tramp passed by. He saw the men again counting. The wanderer soon discovered what was happening. Turns out every man forgot to tell himself. Then he gave them a slap and urged them to tell each other again. It was at that moment that they counted ten and felt very satisfied and cheerful.
