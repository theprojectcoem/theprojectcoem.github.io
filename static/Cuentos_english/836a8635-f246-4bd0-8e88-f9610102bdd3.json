Kings cannot be said to be impossible. He sent for doctors from all animal races, and doctors came from everywhere, well-equipped with prescriptions. Many visits were made to her, but she missed the one of Zorra, who remained locked in her lair. A Wolf, who also courted the dying monarch, reported the absent comrade. And the king commanded that the woman should be brought forth out of her pit, and brought before him. He came, and stood, and suspecting that the Wolf had carried the gossip, he said thus to the Lion, \"I am very afraid, sir, that malicious reports have caused the delay of my presentation to be due to lack of zeal. I want you to know that I was going on a pilgrimage to fulfill a promise I made to you for your health. I have been able to deal with men of knowledge and knowledge on my journey, who I have consulted about the condition that is troubling you. The only thing you need is heat. The years have spent it. - What am I supposed to do? - asked the Lion. - Let them apply the hot, smoky skin of a wolf to you, shaving him alive. It's an excellent remedy for a fallible nature. You'll see what a nice undershirt Mr. Wolf will get you. The king thought the remedy was good, and he ordered the Wolf to be discharged on the spot. They cut it up and cut it into pieces. The Lion ate of them and took his skin. You can flatter yourself without gossip and without exposing yourself to being discovered. Gossip is punished very often.
