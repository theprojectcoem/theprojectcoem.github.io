Another frog passed nearby who had always lived in the sea. He tripped and fell into the well. - Where are you from? - asked the frog from the well. - From the sea. - Is the sea big? - Extraordinarily large, immense. The well frog stayed for a few moments very thoughtful and then asked, \"Is the sea as big as my well?\" - How can you compare your well to the sea! I tell you, the sea is exceptionally large, enormous. And the frog of the pit, out of his anger, said, Lies, there is nothing greater than my pit, nothing. You're a liar and I'm gonna kick you out of here right now! FIN", "title": "Las dos ranas", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
