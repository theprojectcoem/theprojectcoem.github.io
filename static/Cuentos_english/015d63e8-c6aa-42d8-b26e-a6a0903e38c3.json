No, we always sin for a letter of excess or a letter of lack. Wheat, rich gift of the blonde Ceres, if it grows too thick and loose, it squishes the ground and does not grow well. The same goes for trees. To correct that defect in the wheat, God allowed the sheep to cut off the plentiful flour of the loose ones. They fell upon them, and they did such a destruction, that heaven gave the wolves permission to devour some of the oxen. What did the wolves do? To end them all, and if they didn't, that was his intention. Then heaven commanded men to punish those beasts, and men in turn violated God's command. Of all beings, no one is as capable of abuse as the human race. Young and old, everyone can be charged with this defect. No one is exempt from it. Nothing in excess is a maxim quoted by everyone and observed by no one. FIN", "title": "Nada con exceso", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
