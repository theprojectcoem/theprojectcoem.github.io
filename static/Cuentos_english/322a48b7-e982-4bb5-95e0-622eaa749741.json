He asked, \"What do you want?\" The beggar laughed and said, \"You ask me as if you could satisfy my wish? The king laughed and said, \"Of course I can grant your wish. What is it? Just tell me what it is. And the beggar said, Think twice before you promise. The beggar was not just a beggar. He had been the emperor's teacher in a past life. And in this life I promised him, \"I'll come and try to wake you up in your next life. In this life you have not achieved it, but I will return... he insisted: I am a very powerful emperor. What can you wish I couldn't give you? The beggar said to him, \"It's a very simple wish. See that shield? Can you fill it with something? Of course\", said the emperor. So he called one of his servants and said, 'This man's money is full of money. The server did it... and the money disappeared. He threw more and more and as soon as he threw it out he was gone. The beggar's squad was always empty. The whole palace is gathered. This news spread throughout the city, and a great crowd gathered. The emperor's prestige was at stake. And he said to his servants, I am willing to give up my whole kingdom, but this beggar shall not prevail against me. Diamonds, pearls, emeralds... the treasures were emptied. The shield seemed to have no bottom. Everything that was placed in it disappeared immediately. It was sunset and the people were quietly gathered. The king fell at the beggar's feet and admitted his defeat. \"You won\", he said, \"but before you go, satisfy my curiosity\". What's your shield made of? The beggar laughed and said, \"It's made of the same material as the human mind\". There's no secret... it's just made of human desires.", "title": "Deseos", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
