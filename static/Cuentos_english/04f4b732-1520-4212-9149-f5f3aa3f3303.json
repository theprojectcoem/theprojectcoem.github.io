But during the forty days and forty nights of the flood, what happened? Did the beasts resist the temptations of coexistence and forced confinement? Did wild animals, wild beasts of the forests and deserts, submit to the rules of urbanity? The company, inside the same ship, of the eternal victims and the eternal victims, would not unleash any crime? I'm watching the lion, the bear and the snake send to the other world, a bite or a bite, a poor helpless animal. And who would be the most defenseless, if not the most beautiful? Because the beautiful have no protection but their beauty. What good would beauty do them on a ship full of passengers of all kinds, all scared and moody, many of them professional killers, bad-tempered individuals and wreckers? Only the hardest-skinned, the least-appetizing, the barbed-bearded, the horned, the clawed, the peaked, the poison-hiding, the shadowy, the ugliest and strongest, would be saved. When Noah descended to earth after the Flood, he repopulated the world with survivors. But the most beautiful creatures, the most delicate and free, the pure luxuries with which God, in the intoxication of Creation, had adorned the planet, those creatures beside which the feverish and gazel are horrible mammoths and the hare a bloodthirsty beast, woe, those creatures did not descend from Noah's ark.
