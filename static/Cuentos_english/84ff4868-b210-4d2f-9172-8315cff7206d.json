During the afternoon, taking advantage of her husband's absence from the mountain, the woman roasted the fish and ate it. At dusk the man went down and came to his house where his gluttonous companion said to him: \"Ah, my poor Pierre, you don't know what has happened to me! As I untied the gold nail, the scarf slipped out of my hands and ran into the stream. When the man heard these words, he took a staff and began searching all over the house. Their efforts proved futile. The next day, when he was returning home, he passed a fisherman's shop with a goldfish exactly identical to his intended dinner. He whispered, \"I've got you, bitch!\" He grabbed her and took her home. The saleswoman chased him, shouting and insulting him. All the people on the street were laughing... and to calm their spirits, a gentleman paid the fish to the seller. Once at his home, Pierre began to prepare the meal very carefully. He put the fish in a large pot full of water, put it on the fire, and sat down in front of the house with the stick in his hand to make sure the fish didn't escape again. Soon the water began to boil. Believing that the golden one was trying to escape again, he pointed furious stickers at the pot that broke into a thousand pieces. The lying wife was again the cause of that new misfortune. FIN Translation by Esperanza Cobos Castro", "title": "La dorada y los esposos", "author": "Alfred de Musset"}
