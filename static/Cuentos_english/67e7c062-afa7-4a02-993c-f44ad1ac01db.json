A man saw a swan for sale, and having heard that it was a very melodious animal, he bought it. One day the man was having dinner, and he brought the swan and begged him to sing during the feast. But the swan kept quiet. But one day, thinking the swan was about to die, he must have cried his melody beforehand.
