The answer was unquestionable: 'from tomorrow'. When I woke up the next day I found that once again it was hoy, just like y. Since I was to start a new life from tomorrow, I couldn't start it today. It doesn't matter. I thought. Tomorrow will be tomorrow too. And I spent the day quietly in the old one. Not only without remorse of conscience, but full of good feelings and comforting hope. But unfortunately, the next day was again today, just like yesterday and the day before yesterday. It's not my fault I thought some demon wouldn't stop changing tomorrow for today. My decision is irrefutable and irrevocable. Let us try again, perhaps the devil will tire out and tomorrow will be at last tomorrow. Unfortunately, it wasn't like that. It was still today and nothing more than today. I ended up losing hope. Everything seems to indicate that tomorrow will never come, I thought. What if I start the new life not tomorrow but today? However, I soon realized the absurdity of such an approach. Because if today has been repeated invariably for so long, it must be very old already, and therefore any life today must also be old. A new life is a new life and it is only possible if it starts all over again, that is, from tomorrow, if it is to be truly new.
