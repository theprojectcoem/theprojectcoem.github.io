A Mouse, polished and bearded, who knew neither Advent nor Lent, was soothing on the banks of a swamp. And a frog came to him, and said to him in his tongue, Come and see me tomorrow; and thou shalt have a good feast. The Mouse certainly agreed; the Frog had no need to insist any more. Yet he claimed the delights of the bath, the pleasure of the journey, the many things that were in the swamp, worthy of seeing.

There was only one drawback for the Mouse; he was swimming, but he needed help. The Frog soon found the remedy: he tied his hind legs to the front of it: a tender, flexible juncture served the case. Inside the pond, our good nurse is trying to get her partner to the bottom, without noticing people's right or sworn faith. All he thought about was the tasty slices he'd make of his victim, and his nostrils were already coming out. Poor Rat called on all the gods, but the Frog mocked him. He pulled one and resisted the other, and he saw them fighting in the water. Ride over the Rat, carry it between his claws, and behind the Rat the junction loop, and behind the junction loop, the same Frog. The bird that took the double prey was fine!
