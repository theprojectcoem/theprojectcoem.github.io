Since she could not see them before her eyes, the poor girls spent their lives locked in their room. They had a beautiful baby Jesus in it, and they were very devoted to him, and they were always praying to him, bringing flowers and lighting candles. So much so that when the baby Jesus saw them grieving for their confinement, he came down from his pear and began to play with them. But no matter how much they asked him, no matter how much they tried to get him to go with them to visit his father, who was sick, God did not grant the pleas for the betterment of his good father. While they were talking with the child Jesus, they saw the virgin coming in. They did not know her, and were amazed at her beauty and her brightness. The virgin said to the child, \"Son and Lord, please come with me to the bedside of a sick man who is calling us\". The girls sat down on the boy's robe and said, \"Lord, did you not go to take care of our father, who is sick? And the child said to them, Ask my mother; for I will not rejoice, that my blessings shall pass through her hand.
