When they had had had enough, the lion told the donkey to divide the loot between the three of them. He made the donkey three equal parts and asked the lion to choose his own. Outraged for having done the three equal parts, she jumped over it and devoured it. Then he asked the bitch to be the one to distribute. The bitch did a lot of almost everything, leaving the other group with just a few scams. He called the lion to pick again.
