Threatened by modern civilization, they will soon be extinct altogether if not protected. The Commission has already adopted a number of measures in this regard. And is it necessary to protect the elephants? Since the elephant is a prehistoric animal, the son of the mammoth, is it not a symbol of retreat? Does not the same word \"mamut\" incite us to a paternalistic, if not contemptuous, laugh at someone or something who stubbornly adheres to old customs and resists change, or progress, until he is deservedly punished and becomes a fossil? If the elephant is uncomfortable in our civilization, let it die out. Why do other animals, the bed bug, for example, adapt and the elephant not? Is that what you think is best? And why the elephant? Are there any other endangered species? Nobody cares about them, because they only talk about elephants. Why, if you can tell, does the elephant deserve special treatment and the others don't? Is it because you have a cousin at the circus and a brother-in-law at the zoo? Have they facilitated it at higher levels? Did you plug it in? Or maybe the Jews got involved? Who knows if this mastodon really isn't a mastodon... the Masons? Increasingly outraged, I was about to protest publicly, when I came up with a better idea. I'm gonna make myself a pair of ears out of some durable material, preferably nylon, arrange some tubing and go to Africa to join the elephants. Maybe they won't notice I'm in a costume and they'll accept me as one of them. And even if they realize it, maybe they understand it. See if I can survive this way.
