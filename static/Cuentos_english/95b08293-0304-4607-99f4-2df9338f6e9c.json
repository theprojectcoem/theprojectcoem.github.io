He had a well-covered kidney and therefore had a choice; they all moved around to please him. But our gal wasn't in a hurry. Think about it and you'll be right. Two widows were the favorites. One, still green; the other, more seasoned, but repairing with the help of art what had destroyed nature. The two widows, playing and laughing, would comb his hair and fix his head. The oldest one would remove the few black hairs left to make the gallan look more like her. The younger woman, in turn, ripped off her straws; and with this double effort, our good man soon became well without white or black hair. \"Thank you\", he said, \"oh my ladies, you have moved me so well. More is gained than lost, because there's no need to talk about weddings anymore. Any of you who chose would want me to live your life and not mine. Bald head is not good for these moves, so thank you very much for the lesson. FIN", "title": "Un hombre de cierta edad y sus dos amantes", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
