And the other branch answered, 'Yes, really, an empty and boring day. At that moment a sparrow flew over one of the branches and then another landed very close. And one of the sparrows, licking, said, \"My companion has left me. The other sparrow said, \"My companion has also gone away and has not returned. But what do I care?

And the other branch answered and said, Call it what thou wilt; now all is peaceful and clear. And if the high airs make peace I think those who live in the low must make peace too.
