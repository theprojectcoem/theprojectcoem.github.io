We played with the gold alba and the silver moon. I ask you: -How will I get up to you? And they answer me: - Go to the edge of the earth, then lift up your hands to the sky and we will raise you up with the clouds. But I say to them, - My mother is waiting for me at home, how could I leave her to come? Then they smile and floated away. But I know a game that is better than that. I will be the cloud and you the moon. I will cover your face with my two hands, and the ceiling of our house will be blue. The ones who live in the waves call me: -We sing from the white to the black; we move always, always, without knowing where we are going. I ask them: - But how will I join you? -Go -they say- go to the edge of the beach, close your eyes and you will be swept away by the waves. I reply: -But when the night comes my mother wants me by her side; how could I leave her to come? Then they will laugh, and they will dance. But I know a game more fun than that! I will be the waves and you a distant beach. I will ride, I will ride, and like a wave breaking, my laughter will ride your rods. And no one will know anywhere in the world where you or I are.
