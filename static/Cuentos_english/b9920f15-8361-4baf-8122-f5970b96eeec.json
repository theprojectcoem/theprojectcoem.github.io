As they entered a village, they were walking along the donkey, and a crowd of mourners passed by, laughing at them and saying, \"Look at these foolish men! They have a donkey and instead of riding it, they both walk alongside him. At least the old man could get on the donkey. Then the old man got on the donkey and continued on his way. They came to another village, and as they passed by, some people were filled with indignation when they saw the old man riding on his donkey and the boy walking beside him. They said, \"It sounds like a lie! What a fool! The old man sitting on the donkey and the poor boy walking. As they left the village, the old man and the boy exchanged places. They continued on their way to another village. When the crowd saw them, they were shocked and shouted, \"This is unbearable! Have you seen anything like this? The boy riding on the donkey and the poor old man walking beside him. - What a shame! Putting things this way, the old man and the boy shared the donkey. The faithful donkey was now carrying the bodies of both of them on his back. They crossed over to a group of farmers, who shouted, \"Buddies! Don't they have hearts? They're gonna blow that poor animal up! The old man and the boy chose to carry the donkey on their shoulders. So they came to the next village. People gathered around them. Among the laughs, the villagers mock each other and shout: \"We have never seen such stupid people. They have a donkey and instead of riding on it, they ride it up a ladder. This is good! What a pair of fools! Suddenly, the donkey turned, rushed into a ravine and died. FIN", "title": "El anciano y el ni\u00f1o", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
