The defeated people, forced to emigrate, found refuge in La Tierra, more precisely in the waters of the Mediterranean. Ancient landers like Ulysses saw these immigrants, although they couldn't actually see their fish tails, because they didn't have them... but they imagined them. They could take short airspace excursions, just like humans can take a short dive in water. After a couple of centuries, Sirenides became civilized enough to abolish wars. So they remembered the exiles and went for them. They returned to the planet delighted, for from parents to children they had passed on the love of the ancient homeland. That's why the appearance of mermaids on Earth ceased in antiquity. FIN", "title": "No son invenciones de poetas", "author": "Gianni Rodari"}
