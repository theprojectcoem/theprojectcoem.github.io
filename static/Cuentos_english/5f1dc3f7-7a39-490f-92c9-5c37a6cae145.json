He gathered the best doctors from all over the empire, who applied him all the remedies they knew and other new ones they invented on the way, but far from improving, the tsar's condition seemed to get worse and worse. He was given hot and cold baths, eaten eucalyptus syrups, mint, and exotic plants brought in by caravans from distant lands.
