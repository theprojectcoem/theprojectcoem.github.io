But since he could only offer him wheat and weeds, the court mouse said to him, \"You know, buddy, you're an ant's life? But I have wealth in abundance. Come with me and you'll have them at your disposal. They both left for court. He showed the citizen mouse to his friend wheat and legumes, figs and cheese, fruits and honey. The peasant mouse marveled, he blessed his friend wholeheartedly and regretted his bad luck. Ready to throw a feast, a man suddenly opened the door. Frightened by the noise, the two mice rushed fearfully into the holes. They then returned to look for dried figs, but another person stormed into the place, and upon seeing her, the two friends rushed again into a cleft to hide. And the mouse of the field, forgetting his hunger, sighed, and said to the court mouse, Farewell, my friend, I see that thou eatest to fullness, and that thou art very satisfied; but it is the price of a thousand dangers and constant fears. I am a poor man, living and biting barley and wheat, but without any worries or fears of anyone. You can live in luxury and trouble, or in quiet poverty.", "title": "El rat\u00f3n campestre y el cortesano", "author": "nan Esopo"}
