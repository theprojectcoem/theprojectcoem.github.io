The elephant is like a snake. The fourth extended his hand to his knee, touched around and said, \"Obviously, the elephant is like a column. The fifth, who accidentally touched an ear, exclaimed: \"Even the blindest of men would realize that the elephant is like a fan. The sixth, who touched the swinging tail, pointed out: \"The elephant looks a lot like a rope. And so the wise men debated long and hard, each too stubborn in his own opinion, and though partly true, all were wrong. FIN", "title": "Los ciegos y el elefante", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
