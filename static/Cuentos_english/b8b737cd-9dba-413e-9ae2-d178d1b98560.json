In a small lost village in the vast Himalayas, an ascetic, a pilgrim and a brahmin gathered. They began to report how much each of them had given to God from the gifts he received from the faithful. The ascetic said, \"Look, what I do is draw a circle on the floor and throw the coins in the air. Those that fall within the circle I keep for my needs and those that fall outside the circle I offer to the Divine. Then the pilgrim intervened to explain: \"Yes, I also make a circle on the ground and do the same way, but, on the contrary, I stay for my needs with the coins that fall outside the circle and give to the Lord those that fall inside it. Finally, he spoke the Brahmin to express himself in the following way: -I too, dear comrades, draw a circle on the ground and throw the coins into the air. Those that don't fall are for God, and those that fall I keep for my needs. FIN", "title": "El brahm\u00edn astuto", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
