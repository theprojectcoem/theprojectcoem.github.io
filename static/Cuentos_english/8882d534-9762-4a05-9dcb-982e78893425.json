In the vestibule, an abandoned knitting needle lay on the floor; it was the yarn his wife was knitting, I don't know what, to kill time... or to have a pretext of always walking with his eyes down. He well understood. -All is very clear - he said. In the struggle, or whatever, the work has fallen on deaf ears. But the loom was twisted into a spool of infinite blue thread. \u201cWe\u2019ll follow the thread,\u201d he thought. The egg is taken out by the thread.
