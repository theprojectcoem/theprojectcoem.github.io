At the banquet, a drunken and cheerful fellow servant was given the power to heal the sick, even though they were dying. He just had to touch them with his hand or get down by the bed, and they responded instantly. Although the doctor himself should die as soon as he says \"Amen!\" The former poor man became a doctor and soon became a wealthy man. A few years passed and he came up with the idea of visiting Death. Just getting on the road, he found a crying child. Why are you crying? He asked her. Oh, my God! \"The child answered. My father beat me up because I don't know a word of prayer. What word is that? Our father? No, it's not that. The doctor recited the entire prayer to the end, but the answer was always the same: No, it's not that. Then it must be Amen. Yes, said Death. She had been the one who had presented herself under the guise of a child. Yes, I did! And also amen to you! And the doctor died instantly. His sons have divided up all their possessions, and if they have not died, they will be safe and sound until now.
