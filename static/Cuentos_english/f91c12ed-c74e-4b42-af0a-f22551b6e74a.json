He lived in a small house outside the village and was often required by devotees who demanded mystical instruction. One day a group of searches came to him and asked him, \"Teacher, how can you so easily take on your loneliness? How can you not miss a woman who is with you and who supports and comforts you? \"I'm never alone, I assure you\", replied the yogi. I'm a man and a woman. I've managed to unify both polarities in me and I'll never be able to feel alone again. I feel full and always accompanied. For example, when I sweep my house or stretch my canvas, I am a woman; but when I carry heavy weights or short logs, I am a man. Depending on the task I do, I feel like a man or a woman, but I'm not really either, because I'm both at the same time. FIN", "title": "El yogui t\u00e1ntrico", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
