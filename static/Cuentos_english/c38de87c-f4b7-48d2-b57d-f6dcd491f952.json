It was a whole night of reading for you, but have you really discovered the meaning of all this? You know, mother, you know you can tell good stories! I don't understand why your father can't write stories like yours. Is it that your mother never told you stories of giants, fairies and princesses? Or maybe he forgot them? You often put off going to the bathroom, and you have to call it a hundred times. You wait for him, you keep the hot dishes, but he keeps writing and forgets everything. Dad only knows how to play the game of writing books. If I ever play in the father's room, you'll come after me and say I'm bad. If I make a little noise, you laugh: \u2018You don\u2019t see that your father is working?\u2019 Why do you like to write, write always? When I take my father\u2019s pen or pencil and write in his notebook a b c d e f g h i exactly like him, why do you get angry with me, mother? But never protest when it is papa who writes. It doesn't matter that your father has squandered so much time. But if I take a single leaf to make a boat, you will then say to me, \u2018My son, how heavy you are!\u2019 Why do you not laugh at your father, who stretches out more and more leaves, filling them with black letters on both sides?
