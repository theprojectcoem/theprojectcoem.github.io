You obey me and you'll see. The king's chariot was coming down the road. \"Go into the river\", ordered the Cat in Boots to his master, and cried out, \"Help. The Marquis of Carab\u00e1s is drowning! The king and his daughter sent their servants to take the supposed Marquis de Carab\u00e1s out of the river, and provided him with a dry, very beautiful and luxurious suit. He was invited to the royal chariot, and the Cat advanced along the way, and asked the harvesters that, when the king asked who those lands belonged to, they should answer \"from the Marquis de Carab\u00e1s\". He also told the harvesters, and the king was amazed at what his friend the Marquis had. Always advancing the chariot, the cat came to the castle of a giant, and said to him: \"I heard you can become any animal. But I don't think so. - You didn't? - the giant screamed. Then convince yourself. And at one point he took the form of a terrible lion. - That you can't turn into a mouse? - What do you mean, not? Watch it. He turned into a mouse and then AUM! The Cat ate it for a bit, and then went out quietly to wait for the carriage. Welcome to the castle of my master, the Marquis de Carab\u00e1s! Come by, Your Majesty and the lovely princess, to enjoy the banquet that is prepared. The millman's son and the princess got married, and they were very happy. All this prosperity was achieved thanks to the cunning of the Cat in Boots.", "title": "El gato con botas", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
