His first book was a great success; everyone applauded it, and it was soon translated (sometimes not very well) into the most diverse languages. The second was even better than the first, and several of the most brilliant North American professors in the academic world of those distant days commented enthusiastically on it and even wrote books about the books that spoke of the Fox books. From that moment on, Fox was rightly satisfied, and the years passed and he published nothing else. But the others began to murmur and repeat, \"What about Zorro?\" And when they found him at the cocktails they would come to him on time to tell him you have to publish more. \"But if I've already published two books\", he replied tired. \"And very good\", they replied, \"that's why you have to publish another one. Fox didn't say it, but he thought, 'These people really want me to publish a bad book; but since I'm Fox, I won't do it.' And he didn't.
