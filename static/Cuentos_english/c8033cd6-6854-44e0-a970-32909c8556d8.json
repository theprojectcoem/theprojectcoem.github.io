In the middle of the day it was night, and that thing I don't want to define yet is a quiet light inside of me, and I would call it joy, meek joy. I'm a little disoriented as if my heart had been ripped out, and instead of it there was now the sudden absence, an almost palpable absence of what was once an organ bathed in darkness, pain. I'm not feeling anything. But it's the opposite of sop. It's a lighter, quieter way of existing. But I'm also restless. I was organized to comfort myself from anguish and pain. But how do I cope with that simple, quiet joy? I'm just not used to not needing my own comfort. The word comfort came to me without feeling, and I didn't notice it, and when I went to look for it, it had already been transformed into flesh and spirit, it no longer existed as thought. I'll go to the window, it's raining a lot. I am in the habit of looking in the rain for what else might comfort me. But I have no pain to console. Oh, I know. Now I am seeking in the rain such a great joy that it becomes acute, and that it brings me into contact with a sharpness that resembles the sharpness of pain. But it's a futile search. I'm standing in front of the window and that's all that happens: I see rain with beneficial eyes, and rain sees me agree with me. We're both busy flowing. How long will my condition last? I sense that with this question, I'm touching my pulse to feel where the painful beat from before is. And I see there's no painful beat. Just that: it's raining and I'm watching the rain. What a simplicity. I never thought the world and I would get to this point of agreement. The rain falls not because I need it, and I look at it not because I need it. But we're as close together as rainwater is to rain. And I'm not thanking you for anything. If, after I was born, I had not involuntarily and forcibly taken the path I took, I would have always been what I really am: a peasant girl who is in a field where it rains. Without even thanking God or nature. The rain doesn't thank you either. There's nothing to be thankful for having turned into another. I'm a woman, I'm a person, I'm an attention, I'm a body looking out the window. Likewise, rain is not grateful for not being a stone. She's the rain. Maybe that's what you could call being alive. It's nothing but this, just this: I'm alive. And I only live with a modest joy. FIN", "title": "Tanta mansedumbre", "author": "Clarice Lispector"}
