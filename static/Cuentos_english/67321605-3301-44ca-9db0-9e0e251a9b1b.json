It was for her that the carnival was the time for her great initiatives and her great follies. Martina had dressed herself for an airplane carnival, another carnival of Cortesana of Alexandria, and another carnival of pitonisa For the new carnival she thought and thought without ceasing about what she would wear. At that hour when the sun sets and the women reading or sewing by the balcony, because they don't get up from the chair and light up, they're left thinking about their things with their lost gaze through the balcony windows, she was thinking about the costume that would suit her. It's an original costume! A truly original costume! He said, looking up at the sky. But her idea of a costume didn't come up, because she didn't want to dress in any way like a domino, a lady with a mirinaque or a Valencian with a mould full of claws. Then, seeing that inspiration was not coming from heaven, she sold her soul to the devil to wear the most seductive costume, the costume that made all men and the jury lose their heads and the devil then disguised her as an adulteress, and the whole audience of the Grand National Dance chased her that night.
