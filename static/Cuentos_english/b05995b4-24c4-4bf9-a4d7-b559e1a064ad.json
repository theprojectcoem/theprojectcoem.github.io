The guards, although the time of life left to the prisoner was so short, granted his wishes. After three days the tiny ship was finished inside the glass. The morning marked for the execution of the car of faith, when the Holy Office entered the cell of Pablillo Toncton, they found it empty as the bottle. Other convicts waiting for their turn to die said they had heard a candle-like sound the night before, rowing and command voices. FIN", "title": "Historia fant\u00e1stica", "author": "Marco Denevi"}
