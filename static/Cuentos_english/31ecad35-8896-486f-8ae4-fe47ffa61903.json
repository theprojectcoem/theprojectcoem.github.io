Was its number defined or undefined? The problem involves the existence of God. If God exists, the number is defined, for God knows how many birds he has seen. If God does not exist, the number is indefinite, for no one could keep the record. In such a case, we saw less than ten birds (we say) and more than one, but we did not see nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, or two birds. I saw a number between nine and one, which is not nine, eight, seven, six, five, etc. That whole number is inconceivable; therefore God exists.
