With the strength of instinct and the zeal for research, he easily climbed a very tall tree, from which he could observe at will not only the slow sunset but also the life and customs of some animals, which he compared time and again with those of humans. When the evening came, he saw the Rabbit on the one hand, and the Lion on the other. At first nothing worthy of mention happened, but soon afterwards both animals felt their respective presence and, when they came into contact with each other, each one reacted as he had done since man was man. The Lion rocked the Jungle with its roars, shook the melon majestically as was his custom, and held the air with his huge claws; for his part, the Rabbit breathed more quickly, saw a moment in the Lion's eyes, turned around and ran away. Back in town the famous psychoanalyst published his famous treatise cum laude in which he demonstrates that the Lion is the most childish and cowardly animal in the Jungle, and the Rabbit the most courageous and mature: the Lion roars and makes gestures and threatens the universe moved by fear; the Rabbit warns this, knows his own strength, and retires before losing patience and ending that extravagant and out of himself being, which he understands and after all has done nothing to him.
