How I wish I had so much sight, the king lamented. To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance! With this light, I do quite a bit of seeing someone. Soon the messenger arrived. Did you meet anyone on the way? The king asked him. The messenger revealed it to no one. The king was very pleased with the courtyard, for this young woman also saw Noodle. So, naturally, no one can walk more slowly than you. I'm doing what I can! The messenger defended himself, in a bad mood. I'm sure no one walks faster than me!
