A donkey mocks her, and that's strange, because the donkey usually has good nature. He was traveling the world, in the company of a dog, serious and silent, without thinking of anything, followed both by the common master. The master fell asleep, and the Donkey passed by peacefully: he was in a meadow full of appetizing grass. There were no cardos in it, but resign for then to this fault; it must not be so demanding; not because that dish is lacking should a banquet be disregarded. Our Borrico knew, after all, to get rid of him. The dog, starving, said to her, \"Friend, come down a little while and I'll have my lunch in the basket of bread\". The Donkey didn't say a word; to lose a minute was to lose a bite. \"The other one urged him, 'Wait, friend, before the master wakes up and gives you your portion. He will not delay.' In this, a wolf comes out of the forest and comes to them: a third hungry one. The ass cries to the dog for help; the dog does not move, and at last he says, 'Wait, my friend, for the master to wake up, and in the meantime run.' If the wolf catches you, rip off the jaws of a pair of shovels. That's what you're fresh-roasted for. While the Dog said that, the Wolfman strangled the poor Borrico. Wouldn't it have been more useful to help each other? FIN", "title": "El Asno y el Perro", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
