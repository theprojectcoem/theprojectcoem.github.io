He called one of them, Ashok, and handed him a pot full of butter to take to a customer from a nearby village. In return, he promised him some extra rupees. Ashok, very happy, put the pot over his head and started, as he thought to himself: 'I will make two rupees. That's good! With them I will buy chickens, they will soon multiply and I will have nothing less than ten thousand. Then I'll sell them and buy goats. They'll reproduce, I'll sell some of them and buy a farm. Since I'm going to make a lot of money, I'm going to buy fabrics and become a merchant. It'll be great. I'll get married, have a fancy house and, of course, have an excellent cook to prepare the most delicious dishes, and if one day the food doesn't suit me, I'll slap him. Thinking of punching the cook, Ashok automatically raised his hand, causing the pot to fall, which broke into a thousand pieces on the floor and spilled its contents. He went back to the village, dismayed, and met the ruler. \"You fool! \" he exclaimed. You've made me lose my week's earnings! And Ashok said, And I have lost my gain of my whole life.
