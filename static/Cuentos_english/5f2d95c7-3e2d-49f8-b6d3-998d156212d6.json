Rather than support the collective irrationality or do something against it, he left the country. When he reached the border, a customs officer came to him and asked him to write his doctrines for him, the customs officer; and Lao-Tse, afraid of appearing foolish, fulfilled his wish. He compiled his experiences in a short book for the farmer, and only when he had finished it left his native land. With this legend, the Chinese explain the origin of the book Tao-te-king, whose doctrines have shaped their lives to this day. FIN", "title": "Los chinos corteses", "author": "Bertolt Brecht"}
