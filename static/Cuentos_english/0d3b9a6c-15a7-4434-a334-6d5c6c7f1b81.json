Finally one of them spoke. Wanting to humiliate others, he mocked their cowardice and boasted of being the bravest. So he jumped into the water boldly and recklessly. And the strong tide dragged her into the middle of the river; and the women that were with her from the shore followed her, and cried out, saying, Come again, sister, and tell us how we may drink water safely. But the foolish woman, dragged about with no help, and trying to hide her death, said, \"Now I am sending to Miletus; when I return, I will tell you how\". The boastful are always within reach of danger.", "title": "Las zorras a orillas del r\u00edo Meandro", "author": "nan Esopo"}
