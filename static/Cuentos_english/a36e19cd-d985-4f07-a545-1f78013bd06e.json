You don't see the rain coming in through the window and you're getting wet? Oh, the gong is ringing the fourth and brother has to go back to school. What's the matter, mother, why are you so strange? You didn't have a letter from Papa today? The postman brought a letter to everyone today, I saw it. Only the letters of papa are kept in a bag to read them to him. Madam! I'm sure the poster is really bad... but don't be sad about it, mom. Look, tomorrow is the town fair. Let her go and buy some pens and paper. I myself will write you all the letters of Papa. And you will see that you find no shortage. I will write right to you from A to K... Why are you laughing, mother? Do you think I don't know how to write as well as my father? You will see, I will stretch out the paper with a ruler, and I will take great care, and I will make the letters large. And when he concludes, do you think I will be a fool as a father, to write letters in the bag of that fat envelope? I will bring it to you at the moment and help you to deletre it! You know the mailman doesn't like to give you the best letters! FIN", "title": "El cartero malo", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
