A peasant who had nothing to feed his family remembers the custom that promises a strong reward to anyone who is able to challenge and defeat the master of a school of swords. Although he had never touched a gun in his life, the peasant defied the region's most famous teacher. On the set day, before a large audience, the two men face off. The peasant, not impressed by his opponent's reputation, waited for him on his feet, while the swordmaster was a little upset by such determination. Who is this man? Think. No villain would have had the courage to challenge me. Will it not be a trap for my enemies? The hungry peasant is determined to advance toward his rival. The Master doubts, perplexed by the total absence of technique from his opponent. Finally, he retreats, moved by fear. Even before the first assault, the master feels he will be defeated. He lowered his sword and said, \"You are the victor. For the first time in my life, I've been knocked down. Of all the sword schools, mine is the most renowned. She is known as the one who takes ten thousand blows in one gesture. May I respectfully ask you the name of your school? \"The school of hunger\", replies the peasant.
