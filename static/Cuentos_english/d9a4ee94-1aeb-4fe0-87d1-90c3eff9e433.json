The governor of the state came to visit him, and he, after thinking, said, 'This vessel will not be opened by a simple governor.' And a bishop of the diocese came to visit him, but he said to himself, \"No, I will not unpack the vessel\". He will not appreciate its worth, nor will the scent delight his smell. The prince of the kingdom came and had lunch with him. But he thought, My wine is too majestic for a simple prince. And even on the day of his own nephew's wedding, he said to himself, 'No, this dish must not be brought for these guests.' And the years passed, and he died old, and was buried like any seed or bellows. The day after his burial both the old wine vessel and the others were distributed among the inhabitants of the neighborhood. And no one noticed his age. For them, all that's poured into a glass is just wine. FIN", "title": "Aquel viejo, viejo vino", "author": "Gibr\u00e1n Jalil Gibr\u00e1n"}
