He was extremely wealthy, so he had a choice; women struggled to find them well; he was not in a hurry, even though he let them do it, which is a difficult decision of such interest. But two widows were able to entertain her heart, one still young, the other already in maturity, who repaired the cruel ravages with the art of time. These two widows, playing and laughing as they could not, fixed the head of the maiden at their pleasure. The old woman at every moment would unmercifully pull out a little of the black hair that she would show herself there, because her lover would be more to her liking; the young woman, in turn, would gladly remove her white hair, and both of them made our poor maiden bald after all and warned of bad faith. \"Thank you\", said he, \"my lovely women, for having so furry me; I gain more than I lose because I will not marry. The one I took would want to fix me without mercy to his taste, and there's no bald man who can resist a woman. FIN", "title": "El hombre maduro y sus dos novias", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
