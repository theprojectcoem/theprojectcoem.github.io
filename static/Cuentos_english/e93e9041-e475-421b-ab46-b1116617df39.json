Winter came, and with it the cold; and the man put his hands into his mouth, and blew them. The satirist asked him why he was doing it. He replied that his hands were warming because of the cold. Then they served food and the food was very hot. The man took them in pieces, brought them near the mouth and blew them. The satirist asked him again why he was doing it. He said he was cooling the food because it was too hot. \"So listen\", exclaimed the satirist, \"I renounce your friendship, because you blow with your mouth what is cold as well as what is hot! We do not confuse those who seem uncertain in their actions.", "title": "El hombre y el s\u00e1tiro", "author": "nan Esopo"}
