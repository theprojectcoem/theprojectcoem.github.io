The fact, never confirmed, that angels do not make love, may mean that they do not do it in the same way as mortals. Another version, not confirmed but more plausible, suggests that while the angels do not make love with their bodies (for the mere reason that they lack bodies), they celebrate it instead with words, that is to say with the appropriate ones. So, every time angel and angela are in the midst of two transparency, they begin to look, to seduce and to try to seduce each other through the exchange of glances which, of course, are angelic. And if the angel, to open the fire, says, \u201cSelah\u201d, Angela, to extinguish it, responds, \u201cSurco\u201d. He says, \u201cAlud\u201d and she, sweetly, \u201cAbismo\u201d. The words are thrown together, swerving like meteors or stinging like bees. Angel says: \u201cMadero\u201d. And it says: \u201cCavern\u201d. There is a Guardian Angel, silent and meek, and a Death Angel, wrathful and vengeful. But the romantic paramour does not interfere, continues to sing of his love. He says, \u201cMantle.\u201d And she: \u201cIt is.\u201d The sands are impregnated with rock and, here and there, between crystals of snow, air and its expectation circulate. Angel says, \u201cStay\u201d, and Angela, radiant: \u201cHerida\u201d. He says, \u201cStayed\u201d, and she says, \u201cReturned\u201d. And at the exact moment of the ultra-terrestrial orgasm, the arteries and veins, the arteries and veins, tighten, tremble, fall, and the love of the angels pours copiously over the world.
