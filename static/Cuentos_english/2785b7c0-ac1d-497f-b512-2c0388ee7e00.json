Two days later, someone showed me a picture of a magic wand; a looped loop surrounded the chest of its wand. So the sailor, who had been flying through the air and attached to the bulls of the bullring, was no more than an insolent sailor on Sunday afternoon. In the cemetery of the West I saw a solitary cross, carved in red marble; the arms were curving and splayed and surrounded by a circle. That stifled and limited crucified figure was replaced by the free-standing crucified figure, which in turn is replaced by the splayed knee in which a god prayed, the \u201cvile machine\u201d insulted by Lucian of Samosata. Cross, arrow and spear, old tools of man, now discarded or elevated to symbols; I do not know why I am so enchanted, when there is not a single thing on earth that memory does not erase or memory does not alter, and when no one knows in what images the future will translate it.
