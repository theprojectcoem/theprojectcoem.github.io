Its walls are of silver and its ceiling of resplendent gold. The queen lives in a seven-court building and possesses a treasure that has cost seven kingdoms. But be quiet, mother, I will tell you by the ears where my king's palace is. It is in a corner of our azotea, there where the albahaca blooms. The princess sleeps, tucked away on the far side of the seven infernal seas. I am the only one in the world who can find it. His arms are covered with braces and his eyes are pierced with long needles. His cape reaches to the ground. When I touch her with my magical wand, she will awaken, and if she smiles, the most beautiful jewels will fall from her lips. Do you want me to tell you, mother? The princess is in a corner of our pond, where there is the pond of the albahaca. When it\u2019s time for your bath, before you go to the river, raise the tap. You will find yourself sitting in the juncture where the shadows of the two walls meet. Only the cat has permission to be with me, for she knows where the barber of the story lives.
