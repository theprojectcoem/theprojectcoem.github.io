Many perished; the unicorns among others. They had a beautiful ivory horn on their foreheads and humiliated themselves before the maidens. Now, in the ark, sadly, there was not a single maiden. Noah's wives and their three sons were far from it. So the ark must not have greatly seduced the unicorn. Moreover, Noah was a genius, and as such, limited and full of prejudice. At least he's unveiled himself to make the stay of an elegant species bearable. We have to imagine him as he really was: as a businessman of our day: energetic, rude, with excellent character qualities at the expense of sensitivity and intelligence. What did unicorns mean to him, what did the manager of a Yankee factory value in the eyes of a wandering poet's love? Even the patriarch did not possess that pure scientific curiosity that sometimes replaces the sense of beauty. And the ark was quite small and contained a very large number of clean and unclean animals. The bad smell was unbearable. With its silence in this regard Genesis reveals a delicacy which is not pronounced in other passages of the Pentateuch. The unicorns, rather than consent to a murky promiscuity indispensable to the perpetuation of their species, chose to die. Like the mermaids, the cranes, and a variety of dragons whose existence is irrefutably attested to by Chinese pottery, they refused to enter the ark. With gallery, they preferred to go extinct. Without fear they perished nobly. Let us dedicate a minute of silence to them, for we have nothing respectable of modernity outside our silence.
