The pope asked Prince Picco of the Mirandola. In Rome it was not known whether the child was the holy father or his son, the duke of Valentinois, or Lucrecia's husband, Alfonso of Aragon, who passed by powerless. I think he's your son-in-law. But don't you know that an impotent man can't make a child of anyone? How can you believe that nonsense? I believe in it by faith, Picco said, because faith is believing in things because they are impossible.

That's for poor profane like us, but you, who are vice-gods, can believe or do whatever you want. You have the keys of heaven and no doubt St. Peter will not slam the door in your nostrils.

To say you believe what you can't believe is a lie. Peak of the Mirandola was sanctified. Oh, my God! He said, \"Your holiness forgives me, but you are not a Christian\". I believe the Pope did not say that. The following is a list of the most commonly used words in the English language:", "title": "Fe", "author": "nan Voltaire"}
