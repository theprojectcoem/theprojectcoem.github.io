With one last effort, we would find Captain Morgan's legendary treasure. \"Here\", said Gucio, my companion, \"and he nailed the machete to the ground under a broad-branched baobab. It was the place that, long ago, on an encrypted map, had marked with a cross the captain's own hand. We throw the machetes and grab the shovels. Soon we'll discover a human skeleton. \"Everything agrees\", said Gucio. There must be a safe under the skeleton. I was there. We pulled it out of the hole and put it under the baobab. The sun reached its zenith, the monkeys, excited, jumped from one branch to the other; the skeleton showed its teeth, smiling. Breathing heavily, we sat on top of the safe. \"Fifteen years\", said Gucio. It was the time that had passed since we started looking for the treasure. We turned off the cigarettes and took some iron bars. The monkeys were screaming more and more, just like the parrots. Finally, the lid gave way. At the bottom of the safe was a piece of paper and it said, \"Kiss my ass\". Morgan, please. The goal is never the important thing  said Gucio. What counts is the effort to pursue it, not the fact of reaching it. I killed Gucio and went home. I like the morals, but not the passing.
