He imposed, time and again, penances that he failed to fulfill. Is there any penance you can fulfill? The clergyman asked him. On my farm there is an apple that produces fruits so acidic and miserable that I could never eat them. If you agree, may it be my penance that in my lifetime I never taste one of those apples. \"For all your sins, I command you, never to eat from that tree knowingly. The gentleman left and felt that there was no such penance imposed. But the tree was in a place where the gentleman could see it every time he entered or left his farm. This always reminded him of prohibition, and with that remembrance, soon the strongest temptation came. One day, he passed by the tree and looked at the apples. Then, stretching out his hand toward an apple, and then pulling it back again, he spent almost the whole day between pushing and pulling back. The fight against desire was, however, so hard that he lay under the apple tree with a beating heart and died.
