This is evidenced by the following story: A hermit lived by the river. He was fed by a dairy who gave him milk every day for his livelihood. The hermit had given a mantra to the good woman and said to her, \"By repeating this powerful mantra you can go across the ocean of existence. Time has passed. One day when the dairy was going to cross the river to bring milk to the hermitage, it rained torrentially and the river water overflowed. There was no way to cross the river by boat. The woman remembered what the hermit had said: Repeating this powerful mantra you can go across the ocean of existence. And she said to herself, 'This is just a river.' He repeated the mantra inwardly with much love and motivation and began to walk on the water until he reached the hermit. When he saw her, this man, very surprised, asked, \"How did you get here when the river has been overflowing?\" The woman replied, \"As you told me that with the mantra you gave me I could cross the ocean of existence, I thought it would be much easier to cross the river. On hearing this explanation, the hermit was filled with vanity and thought,!What a degree of evolution I must have when the dairy has been able to do this feat with my mantra! Days later, the hermit had to go to the city. The monsoon rains had not stopped and the river was still overflowing. The hermit thought there was no problem. If the mantra had worked with the dairy, how could it not work with him? He began to repeat the mantra and threw himself into the river waters. It automatically sank to the bottom and perished.
