Yaces sitting, smoking, on the corner of the big sofa. Yazgo sat, smoking, on the sofa in the lower seat. There was not, it will take an hour, but the glances of one will to say. We had just refilled the cigars \u2014the new one in the place of the old one\u2014 and we continued the quiet conversation, interrupted only by the faint desire to speak... Yes, it is useless, but everything, up to life in the open air, is equally useless. There are things that are difficult to say... this issue, for example, of who likes her, how can we get to talking about that? I don't even talk about it, isn't it? And most of all, don\u2019t be the first one to think about talking about it! Talk about her to the implacable other and friend... The ash of your cigar has fallen on your black jacket\u2014I would warn you, but for that you must speak... We shall meet again, as if we were strangers crucified.
