Low and thick, his fifty-six years of kind and quiet life did not accuse more than forty. She was counting on an episode that might mark the only intense page in her existence, and I heard her tell more than a hundred times that tragic moment, which she narrated to the smallest hint, with always the same latent terror. He was then serving don Venancio G\u00f3mez, a cruel and brutal individual, who divided his time between violent orgies in Buenos Aires and short visits to his stay, where he only came from time to time in order to tighten certain clavicles for greater performance. He went one day looking for him in the village. The telegram said: \"I arrive tomorrow at 11 a.m. \" Good time I had chosen for the heat that had been going on for several days! He got into the car, without answering Santos' greetings, and questions about the administration began. To every thing disapproved by don Venancio followed a rosary of insults, which his interlocutor tried to avoid claiming his impotence as a simple pawn. The gentleman must have been taking it.

There's a patron, a little boy, a Christian on the side of the alley! Soon they stopped in front of the unhappy man, who, humbly, approached obeying the signs of the drunk. Hat in hand, he stopped, a broad bald man shining in the sun, and as he bent down to make a reverential bow, the other, slowly, leaning his gun toward that old furry, barely surrounded by straw.
