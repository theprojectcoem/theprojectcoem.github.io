Wine without label, so it could be black, white, yellow, etc. Many countries, on that day, randomly selected a child of 5 billion to honor and even to film and record his first cry. However, the real Five Billion Child was not honored, nor was he filmed, nor even had energy for his first cry. He was already starving before he was born. A starving hunger. A old hunger. When he finally moved his hands, they touched dry ground. Four-sided and dry. Earth with cries and footprints of dogs or camels or cattle. Also with the child's scale 4.999.999.999. The real Five Billion child had hunger and thirst, but his mother had more hunger and thirst, and her dark tummies were like the barren earth. Along with her, the boy's grandfather was starving and eating more old food and was no longer interested in thinking or believing. One week later the Five Billion Baby was a skeleton sized skeleton and consequently the horrible risk of the planet becoming super-populated was reduced somewhat.
