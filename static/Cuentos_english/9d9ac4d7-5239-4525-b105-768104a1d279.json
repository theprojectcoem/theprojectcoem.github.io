A well-dressed man, probably a traveler from the great city, came up and stood before him. His presence intimidated the old man. His smile was like that of a small child. His swollen and wrinkled face was adorned with a prominent nose. \u2014Do you suffer from all, catarrh, tisis, or some bleeding disease?\u2014he asked almost in a pleading tone. The forasterer refused with his head. The old man stood up. \u2014Hemorrhagic diseases are really something really awful, I say\u2014his agitated tongue swung between his teeth. He puts his hand on the traveler's shoulder and laughs. \u2014Yes, sir \u2014he exclaimed. I cure everything: scabies, catarrh, tisis, bleeding disorders. Removes wrinkles from hands. Don't ask me how I do it. It is a mystery. No smear. It's free. I'm Tom. Is that okay? The foreman shook his head, he was a very nice man. The elderly gave him an attack of nostalgia. \u201cMy father was a tough guy,\u201d he said. He was a professional herder, like me, though he never wore a hat. When the grain had grown enough, he told the poor, \u201cGo to the fields and pick what you want,\u201d but when the war began, he charged a rich man five dollars for a few sacks of grain. I fought against his will. One day he came to me and said, \u201cGet out of here Tom, I have to tell you something, that girl doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d \u201cTo me, yes,\u201d he replied. \u201cNo, not to me,\u201d he said. My father and I sat in a throne. He was a handsome man and he wore a hat. \u201cWhether you like it or not, I\u2019m marrying you,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about my money,\u201d he said. My wedding cost me twenty dollars \u2014 I earned them working in the grain fields \u2014 and that day it rained. The horses were blind. The doctor asked me, \u201cHave you already fulfilled the twenty-one?\u201d I said \u201cyes\u201d and she said \u201cyes\u201d. We had it written in chalk on the shoes. My father said, \u201cGo on, you are free.\u201d We were without money. My wedding cost me a hundred dollars. She's dead. The old man lifted his head. He had already shivered. Grey clouds covered the sky. \u201cI will draw some nice pictures and then I will give them away,\u201d he said. My brother is in prison. He killed a man who, he says, insulted him. The elderly decrepit man lifted his hands and taught them to the traveler. She had black mummy eyes. \u201cI remove the wrinkles from my hands,\u201d he said, wailing. What soft hands. I picked up the accordion. You are thirty-seven years old. The other day I went to visit my brother in prison. I sat by his side. He is a handsome man and has a beautiful hair. \u201cAlbert,\u201d I asked, \u201care you sorry for having killed that man?\u201d He answered me furiously, \u201cHow shall I repent, I will do it again, I will kill ten, a hundred, a thousand!\u201d The old man began to weep and his hands were washed with his muddy rag. When he tried to chew tobacco, his teeth were displaced. Regretfully, he shut his mouth with his hands. \u2014I'm old. You have thirty-seven years, I have quite a few more, he murmured. My brother is a bad person \u2014 he is full of hatred; he is an attractive man and has a beautiful hair, but he has killed a man, life is nothing to him. Goodbye the sight. I am ashamed to be so old. I've come back to marriage. I would have to see my wife, she's very pretty. I wrote four letters to him and he responded. He came here and we married. I love to see her walking. I make her gifts, you know, very pretty dresses. He has a twisted leg \u2014 he's not straight \u2014 my first wife is dead. It removes wrinkles from hands without shedding a drop of blood. Cure all, catarrh, tisis, hemorrhagic diseases. You can write to me, I answer all letters. If you don\u2019t have to pay, there\u2019s no problem. No smear. It's free. The old man's eyes were again swollen. The foreman tried to comfort him: \"Are you happy?\" he asked. - Yes, - the old man replied - and I am also a good person. Ask there if you want. I'm Tom, I'm a professional sailor. Although she has a twisted foot, my wife walks with style. I have given her a long dress. He's thirty, I'm sixty-five. He has lots of shoes. I have bought some for him, he has a twisted foot, but to me it's equal, I buy him straight shoes. She thinks I don't know \u2014 everyone thinks Tom doesn't know. I have given her a long dress that goes to her feet. I'm Tom, I'm a professional sailor. I am 67 years old. I give you my age. It removes wrinkles from hands without shedding a drop of blood. You can write to me, I answer all letters. No smear. It's free. FIN \u201cSenility\u201d, The Little Review, 1918", "title": "Senilidad", "author": "Sherwood Anderson"}
