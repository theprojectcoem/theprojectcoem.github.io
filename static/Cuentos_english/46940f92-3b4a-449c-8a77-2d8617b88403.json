The family consisted of Juan Smothers, his wife, a five-year-old daughter and her parents, which justified mentioning a considerable number of citizens in the patrons. But for practical purposes, only three citizens were available at the Smothers' home. One night, after dinner, the girl suffered a serious stroke and John Smothers had to go out to get some medicine.

Her mother was very upset about her husband's disappearance, so it was three months before she remarried and moved to San Antonio.

John Smith, who was the name of the husband of the patient's mother, intervened. I'll go downtown and get the right medication. No, no, dear John! \"I'm sorry\", his wife exclaimed.
