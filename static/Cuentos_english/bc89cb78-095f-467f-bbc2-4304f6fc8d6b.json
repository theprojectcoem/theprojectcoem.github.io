When she was hungry, she went to her sister and said, \"My children are starving, but you are rich. Give me a piece of bread. The rich woman replied, \"There is no bread in our house. \" And she sent her away with a hard heart. A few hours later the rich sister's husband returned home, and as he began to break bread for food, he was amazed to see drops of blood coming out as he broke it. His wife, frightened, told him everything that had happened. He hurried to the poor widow and brought her all the food she had. When he came out to go home, he heard a loud noise and saw a cloud of smoke and fire rising up to heaven. He was burning down his house. He lost all his wealth in the fire. His cruel wife, screaming in rage, said, \"We're going to starve to death. \"God helps the poor\", replied her good sister, who ran to her side. The rich woman begged for her own money, but no one took pity on her. Her sister, forgetting her cruelty, shared with her the alms she received.
