The normal or ordinary scream consists of a general facial contraction and a sonic sound accompanied by screams and moans, these latter at the end, for the scream ends at the moment when one is heard energically. To cry, direct your imagination toward yourself, and if this proves impossible because you have broken the habit of believing in the outside world, imagine a pond covered with ants or those gulfs in the Straits of Magellan where no one ever enters. Once the scream comes, you will be able to close your face with decorum using both hands with the palm facing inward. The children will cry with the bag strap against their faces, and preferably in a corner of the room. The average length of the yell, three minutes.
