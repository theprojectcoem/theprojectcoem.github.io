He found a glistening, rolling-on Mastin who had gone astray. To commit and destroy it, was something that Mr. Wolf would have done willingly; but a singular battle had to be undertaken, and the enemy had traces of a good defense. The Wolf approaches him with the greatest courtesy, engages in conversation with him, and congratulates him on his good meats. \"You are not as handsome as I am, because you do not want to\", replied the Dog. \"Leave the forest; your people, who shelter in it, are miserable, always starving to death. Not a safe piece! All in the name of luck! Always in the blink of an eye! Follow me and you'll have a better life. The Wolf asked, \"What am I supposed to do?\" \"Almost nothing\", replied the Dog, \"to touch the porters and those who carry sticks or clubs; to caress the household, and to please the master. With as little as this, you'll have for gajes good pimples, the leftovers of all meals, chicken and chicken bones, and some caresses, by the way. The Wolf, who hears such, forges a future of glory, which makes him cry with joy. As they walked, he noticed that the dog had a fur on his neck. - What's that? - What's that? - he asked. - I'm not doing anything. - It's not like anything! - It's a small thing. - Something will be. - It'll be the signal from the necklace I'm tied to. -Trapped! - exclaimed the Wolf, - so what? You can't just go and come where you want? - Not always, but that, what does it matter? \"It matters so much that I give up your food, and at that price I would give up the greatest treasure\", he said, and ran away. He's still running. FIN", "title": "El lobo y el perro", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
