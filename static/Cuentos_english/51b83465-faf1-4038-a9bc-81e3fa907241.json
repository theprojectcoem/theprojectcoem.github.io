A turtle was coming out of her deep sleep and desponding on the beach. He opened his eyes and suddenly saw a fish pulling its head out of the water. When the fish noticed the turtle's presence, it said, \"Turtle ant, I feel that there is wisdom in your heart and I want to ask you a question: what is water?\" The turtle didn't replay instantly. She couldn't believe what that fish was asking her. When he realized that he was awake and the event was not part of a dream, he replied: \"Fish, you were born in water, in water you are living and in water you will find death. There's water around your body and water inside your body. You feed on what you find in the water and in the water you reproduce. And you, foolish fish, ask me what water is!
