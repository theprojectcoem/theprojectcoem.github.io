To begin with, he walks on four legs, and this is unusual for a theologian; it is so wide that not all doors allow his passage, and in a car, if he ever got into one, he would never know where to put his wings anyway. Because of the horns, no hat fits him, and when he grows, he shakes the building. He is a true expert on everything related to the Dead Sea Scrolls, and he has written two authoritative books about the candidate community of Khirbert Qumran. But his hind legs are too short, and when he walks he has his hands crammed into two huge gloves, or rather, hand blinds. Some say that flames come out of their mouths, but that must be a literary image; or perhaps someone has taken for a fire the red saliva that continually comes out of their mouths. The truth is, it weighs 300 pounds, and its volume is right for its weight. The wings, then, are useless, too heavy to fly, and can be considered a theological whim: rigid and shiny, upright like those of a winged bull, but much more voluminous. The horns are massive and both point up and forward, like a canopy hanging over the eyes. He was the one who definitively clarified the total independence of Christianity from the religion of the Essenes, as is the result of the analysis of the superstitious texts, and therefore the absolute originality of Jesus and his theories. When he sleeps, his breathing makes a whistle that can be heard even in the square. His girlfriend told a friend that in bed he's acting like the Beast of Revelation.
