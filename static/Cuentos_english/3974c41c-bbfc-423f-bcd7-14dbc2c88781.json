To give advice, you need to be completely sure that the advice is good, and to do that, you need to be absolutely sure (which no one is) that you are in possession of the truth. And then it is necessary to know whether those counsels are adapted to the individual to whom they are given, for which it is necessary to know all their souls, which is almost never possible. And you also have to realize that the way you give advice must be exactly tailored to that soul; sometimes you are advised to do things you don\u2019t want to do so that, combined with elements of the soul you are being advised to, you get the result you want. Only the most gullible people give advice. FIN", "title": "La inutilidad de dar consejos", "author": "Fernando Pessoa"}
