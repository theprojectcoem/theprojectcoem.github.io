However, people said that his wife did not love him and even more so, that she hated him. One day, a princess from a neighboring town came to visit the princess of Shawakis. And they sat down, and talked, and their words were directed unto their husbands. The princess of Shawakis said passionately: \"I envy your happiness with the prince, your husband, despite all the years of marriage. I hate my husband, he doesn't belong to me alone and I'm the happiest woman. The visiting princess, looking at her, said, \"My friend, the truth is that you love your husband. Yes, and you still have a passion for him. And that's life for a woman, like spring for a garden. But have mercy on me and my husband, for we endure each other in patient silence. And yet you and the others consider that happiness. FIN", "title": "Las dos princesas", "author": "Gibr\u00e1n Jalil Gibr\u00e1n"}
