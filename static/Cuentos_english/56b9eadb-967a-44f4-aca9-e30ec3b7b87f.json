He walked long, light and short, since he had only put on the spark plug and sandals to be more agile. So equipped, she swirled in her imagination what she would get out of milk and how to use it. He bought a hundred eggs, made three chicks; with his diligent care, everything went well. It's easy to raise chickens around the house. As smart as the fox is, I'll have enough to buy a pig. Fat him up, it's a matter of a little saving. When I bought it, it was already quite large; when I sell it again, it will be worth a lot of money. And who will hinder me, being so valiant, to bring a good cow into the stable with her calf, and see her tremble among the flock? When she says this, Juanita also jumps, full of joy. The spider falls and the milk is spilled. Goodbye cow and calf! Bye, you little pig! Bye, you little chicks! The owner of so much wealth, looking with sad eyes at her fortune for the soils, again apologized to her husband, and saw herself in danger of a good tail. Who doesn't have any illusions? Who doesn't build castles in the air? All, from the proud Pirro to the Milk-maker; all, the same wise as the mad. We dream awake, and there is nothing more pleasant; flattering fantasies take hold of our soul; all the goods of the world are ours then, riches, honours, women. When I'm alone, I'm so brave I challenge the bravest, and I'm going to overthrow the Persian sufi. They have chosen me king; my people worship me; they have made crowns to rain upon my breasts. But maybe any accident brings me back to reality, and I'm a poor John just like before. FIN", "title": "La Lechera", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
