My boat is waiting at the port, already loaded and fully laden. And now think about it, mother, before you tell me what you want me to bring you when you come back. Do you want a huge amount of gold, mother? There, on the banks of the gold rivers, the fields are replete with golden grain. In the dark of the forest, the gold flowers of the champa flower on the ground. With them I will fill hundreds of boxes for you. Do you want, mother, pearls as big as the drops of autumn rain? I will sail to the beaches of the island of pearls. There, at dawn, there are pearls that flutter on the flowers of the park, pearls that fall without stopping on the grass, and the foam of the rippling waves settles in pearls on the sand. I will bring my brother a couple of flying horses to fly him through the clouds. I will bring my father a magic pen that will write itself. For you, mother, I must conquer the treasure that was bought with the kingdoms of the seven kings. FIN", "title": "El mercader", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
