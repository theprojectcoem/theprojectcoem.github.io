Some held that the world is eternal, and others that it is not; some that the world is finite, and others, infinite; some that body and soul are the same, and others, that they are different; some, that the Buddha has existence after death, and others, that he does not. And so each defended his views, giving himself up to prolonged controversies. All this was heard by a group of Buddhist monks, who later reported the incident to the master and asked for clarification. The Buddha asked them to sit quietly beside him, and he spoke in this way: \"Monks, these dissenters are blind who do not see, who do not know both truth and non-truth, both the real and the unreal. Ignorant, polemical and contentious, as I've been told. Now I will tell you an event from ancient times. There was a maharaja who called all the blind people in Sabathi and asked them to stand before an elephant and tell them, as they went to touch the elephant, what they thought. Some touched the head and said, \"An elephant looks like a bucket\". Those who touched the ear said, \"It looks like a basket\". Those who touched the chin said, \"It's like a plowing net\". Those who touched the body said, \"It's a barn\". Each of them was convinced of what he was saying, and they began to quarrel among themselves. The Buddha paused and broke the silence to conclude: \"Monks, this is what those dissident ascetics are like: blind, ignorant of the truth, who nevertheless hold on to their beliefs.
