With one of his slaves he had a daughter and he fed her with venom. The girl grew up, beautiful and lethargic. His lips reserved death for the one who kissed them. The king sent her to Alain as his wife, and Alain, when he saw her, was enchanted and wished to kiss her immediately. But Aristotle, his philosopher-master, suspected that the girl was a delectable food and, to be sure, made a scoundrel, condemned to death, kiss her. Just as she kissed him, the malhechor died bursting with pain. Alejandro did not want to put his lips on the girl, not because she was full of poison, but because another man had drunk from that cup.", "title": "El beso", "author": "Enrique Anderson Imbert"}
