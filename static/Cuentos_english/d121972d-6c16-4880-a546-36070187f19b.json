{"metadata": {"length": 1630, "words": 301, "reading_time_min": 1.505}, "text": "The danger is that, sooner or later, the news will reach Toboso. It will become the fantastic story of a handsome, wealthy young man who, lostly in love with a tobo-sin lady, has had the occurrence (for some, madness) of becoming a walking gentleman. Versions, oral and dissimilar, will say that Don Quixote has been caught by the lady without having seen her but once and from afar. And that, ignoring her name, she gave her the name Dulcinea. They'll also say that at any moment he'll come to the Toboso to ask for Dulcinea's hand. Then the women of the Toboso adopt a tongue-in-cheek air, princess-like ademanes, dreamy expressions, hieratic postures. They're given to reading poems of exacerbated romanticism. If they knock on the door, they'll get a hangover. They go all day in the best clothes. They're carrying endless trees. Some learn to sing or play the piano. And all of them, even the ugliest ones, look in the mirror and make faces. They don't want to get married. They reject advantageous marriage proposals. They grunt and look away, telling the candidate: \"Sorry, I'm engaged to another man\". If your parents ask you why you're so upset, you say, \"They won't expect me to marry anyone\". And they add: \"Happily, not all men are equal\". When someone narrates in their presence Don Quixote's last adventure, they have hysterical crises of hilarity or crying. They don't eat that day and they don't sleep that night. But time passes, Don Quixote doesn't show up and the women of the Toboos have begun to age. However, they continue to embroider to the point of reading Cervantes' book and judging it a libel. FIN 1984", "title": "Epidemia de Dulcineas en el Toboso", "author": "Marco Denevi"}
