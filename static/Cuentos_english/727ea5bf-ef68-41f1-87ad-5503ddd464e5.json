For that reason, when his son turned 14, an old Turkish man, sought out the local teacher to exercise in laziness. The professor was well known and respected, for in his life he had chosen only the path of least effort. The old man went to visit him and found him in the garden, lying on cushions, in the shade of a fig tree. He looked at him a little before he spoke to him. He was still like a dead man, with his eyes closed, and only when he heard the chase! He announced a ripe fig falling a short distance away, and he would stretch out his arm to grab it, carry it to his mouth, and swallow it. \"This is, without a doubt, the teacher my son needs\", he said. He approached her and asked if she was willing to teach her son the science of laziness. Man, the professor said to him with a voice-thread, don't talk so much that I'm tired of hearing you. If you want to turn your son into a real Turk, just send him. The old man took his son, with a pillow of feathers under his arm, and said to him, \"Imitate the teacher in everything he doesn't do. The boy, who had a special inclination for this science, saw that the teacher, whenever a fig fell, stretched out his arm to pick it up and swallow it. 'Why this fatigue of stretching out his arm?' he thought, and lay down with his mouth open. A fig fell into his mouth and he slowly threw it down. Then he opened his mouth again. Another fig fell a little further away. The disciple kept quiet and said, \"Why so far?\" I'm going to get my mouth! The teacher, noticing the wisdom of his disciple, said to him, \"Go home, you have nothing to learn here\". It's me, rather, who should learn from you. And the son returned with his father, who thanked heaven for giving him such a clever branch. FIN Italian name unknown", "title": "La ciencia de la pereza", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
