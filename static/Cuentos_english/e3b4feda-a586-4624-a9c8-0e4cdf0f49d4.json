Lives in the deep waters and comes to the surface at dark, stormy or rainy nights to do harm. He is speaking from the water, from rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. Give voice when you see boats, sails and canoes, or also houses on the shores. With the ensuing shriek of the sailor and something else, it calls: \u201cUf!\u201d \u201cUf!\u201d... It may also sound like the shivering of the wind, or that of some other animal, and even the muttering of a human being. If you go to earth, the Unguymaman calls from house to house, without knocking on the door, with the same voice. It is a voice that can be recognized by its liquour and sweetness. Anyone who hears the Unguymaman, man, woman or child, should not respond. If he responds, the Unguymaman will give him the disease. You don\u2019t have to answer with a single word or nothing. The person who needs us, should knock on the door or call us by speaking, to be recognized properly. Only in such cases will it be contested. The Unguymaman is known only as a malicious being, whose form no one has come to need. Who could see her during those London nights when she leaves her usual home and goes in search of her victims? To do harm, base the voice, but only if it is challenged. FIN Panki and the Warrior, Lima, 1968", "title": "La Madre de las Enfermedades", "author": "Ciro Alegr\u00eda"}
