And they laughed. On a balcony on the first floor there was a good old man reading the newspaper, and looking out the front window there was a young woman neither good nor bad. - What a fool these kids are! - said the lady. But the good man disagreed: \"I don't think so. - You're not gonna tell me you understand what they said... The first one said, \"What a beautiful day\". The second one replied, \"Tomorrow will be even nicer\". The lady nodded, but she said nothing, because the children had begun to speak their language again. \"Maraqui, barabasqui, we'll pee this\", said the first. \"Bruf\", replied the second. And again the two of them started laughing. - He won't tell me he's got them now! - exclaimed the old woman indignantly. \"Now I understand everything too\", replied the old man with a smile. The first one said, \"How happy we are to be in the world\". And the second one said, \"The world is beautiful\". - But is it really pretty? - the old lady insisted. \"Brif, bruf, braf\", the old man replied.
