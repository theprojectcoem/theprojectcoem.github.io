But I didn't have the courage to testify, because I'm a little sloppy and I don't seem attractive to women. That's why I decided to develop my body first and then declare myself. We work the body out by doing exercises that involve lifting weights. We hold the weight with our thumb and index finger, lift it up, and, by a contraction of the biceps, lift it to the height of the larynx. The last stage of the exercise involves tilting the body backwards, which increases the elasticity of the spine, specifically the cervical vertebrae. If the exercise is done correctly, a slight growl should be heard. A few exercises like this are enough to make blood flow faster through the veins and the eyes shine. When I was still a rookie, I started with a 50-gram weight. In a short time, my biceps increased in volume and I weighed over 100. Looking in the mirror, I also noticed beneficial changes in my nose, which had grown and acquired a healthy pink color. I worked my body hard, although I occasionally blamed fatigue, particularly the morning after the gymnastics session. Finally, the day came when I could declare myself uncomplicated to my beloved. I first rehearsed a lot with a fellow club member and, at dawn, I went to the girl's house. I stripped myself in front of the door, strained my muscles and rang the bell.
