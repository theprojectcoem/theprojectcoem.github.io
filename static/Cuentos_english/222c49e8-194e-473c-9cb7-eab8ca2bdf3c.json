And a man of the field came to him, and said, Man, go on. The next day, as the sun began to clear the morning mist, the woodcutter was preparing to undertake the hard work of the day. He remembered the advice he had received the day before and decided to go deeper into the forest. He then discovered a splendid sandalwood tree trunk. This wood is the most valuable of all, distinguished by its special aroma. A few days passed. The woodcutter recalled the suggestion of the anchovy and determined to penetrate the forest even further. That's how he found a silver mine. This fabulous discovery made him very rich in a few months. But the woodcutter kept the words of the anchorette very alive: \"Go ahead\", so one day he went further into the forest. It was in this way that he now found a gold mine and became an exceptionally rich man. FIN", "title": "Sigue adelante", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
