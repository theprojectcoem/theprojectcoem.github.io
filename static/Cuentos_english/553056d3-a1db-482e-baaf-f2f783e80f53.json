With a knife he cut one of his tiny fingers, handing it to the queen, who kept it in the scythe, feeling it descend to her belly, with cold worm twisting. Then, obeying an order, the pagans placed the corpse on the pile of mortar, into which it began to sink slowly, from behind, as if it had been plucked by viscous hands. The corpse had been arched a little on the ascent, having been picked up, still warm, by the servants. That's why her belly and thighs disappeared first. The arms and boots continued to float, as indecisive, in the moving grayness of the mixture. Then only the face was left, supported by the canopy of the bicornio, pierced from ear to ear. Fearing that the mortar would harden without having completely swallowed his head, the governor held his hand to the king's forehead, to sink it sooner, with a gesture of the one who takes the temperature from a sick person. Finally, the mortar closed over Henri Christophe's eyes, who was now continuing his slow journey downward, in the very gut of a moisture that was becoming less enveloping. Finally, the body stopped, made one with the stone that pressed it. Having chosen his own death, Henri Christophe would ignore the rottenness of his flesh confused with the very matter of the fortress, inscribed within his architecture, integrated with his fortress-like body. The entire Mount of the Bishop's Hat had been transformed into the mausoleum of Haiti's first king. FIN", "title": "El entierro de Henri Christophe", "author": "Alejo Carpentier"}
