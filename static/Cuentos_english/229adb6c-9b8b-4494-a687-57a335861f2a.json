The emperor's wish was to know those provinces. The painter traveled a lot, visited the recesses of the new territories, but returned to the capital without a single image, without even a sketch. The emperor was surprised, and even angry. Then the painter asked to be left with a large wall canvas of the palace. On that wall, he represented the entire country he had just walked through. When the work was finished, the emperor went to visit the great fresco. The painter, with a stick in his hand, explained to him all the corners of the landscape, the mountains, the rivers, the forests. When the description was finished, the painter approached a narrow path that came out of the foreground of the fresco and seemed to get lost in space. The assistants had the feeling that the painter's body was slowly sinking into the path, that it was slowly advancing through the landscape, that it was getting smaller. Soon a curve of the path hid it from his eyes. And in an instant the whole landscape disappeared, leaving the great wall naked. The emperor and the people around him went back to their rooms in silence. FIN", "title": "El paisajista", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
