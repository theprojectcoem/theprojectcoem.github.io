Nor today, even pretending - as if being robbed - not knowing that thousands of evenings ago the spy would consent to lose, with the mere guessing of his shadow, a penny of his dignity, to see him fall to the barefoot shore of the boatmen beside the spotted and grated strawberries by the marmots of the sirga.

Guess how I would share their alms with you, saying, 'Look!,' and how we would run and resonate, multiplying it, hand in hand, barge in barge, its coin, water pouring down to the mountains, water pouring down to the sea, until it was exchanged for a great feast?
