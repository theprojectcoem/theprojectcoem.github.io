He had only one disciple, to whom he gradually taught the mystical teaching. The sky had been tinted with a beautiful orange-gold hue, when the master turned to the disciple and commanded him: \"My dear, my dearest, come near the cemetery and, once there, with all the strength of your lungs, begin to shout all kinds of praise to the dead. The disciple walked to a nearby cemetery. The silence was overwhelming. He broke the peaceful atmosphere of the place shouting all kinds of praise to the dead. Then he went back to his teacher. - What did the dead say? - asked the teacher. - They didn't say anything. - In that case, my dear friend, he goes back to the cemetery and hurls all kinds of insults at the dead. The disciple returned to the silent cemetery. At his full lungs, he began to release all kinds of improprieties against the dead. After a few minutes, he returned to the teacher, who asked him immediately, \"What have the dead answered you?\" \"They said nothing again\", replied the disciple. And the teacher said, Thus is it to thee, that thou shouldest be, as a dead man, to the praise and the reproach of others. FIN", "title": "S\u00e9 como un muerto", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
