The day he died came. St. Peter didn't want to receive him, because all he had done in his life was pray to St. Joseph. Of good deeds, no words; and the Lord, the Virgin and the other Saints seemed to not exist for him. \"Since I have come this far\", said the devotee of St. Joseph, \"at least let me see it\". St. Peter sent for him. And Joseph went out, and saw his servant, and said, Well, I am glad that thou art with us. Come on, get through. I can't. This one doesn't want to. And why? He says I prayed only to you, and nothing to the other Saints. Ah, come on, what does it matter. It's the same. But St. Peter insisted he didn't want to. Word goes, word comes, finally Saint Joseph said to him: \"Either you let him in, or I take my wife and my son and go with me to Paradise somewhere else\". His wife was the Virgin and his son was Our Lord. St. Peter thought it best to go in and let him in. FIN Italian name unknown", "title": "El devoto de san Jos\u00e9", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
