And he was eloquent, and his fame spread over the earth. One afternoon, three men came to his hermitage and greeted him. \"You preach giving and sharing\", they told him. And you seek to teach those who have much to give to those who have little; and we have no doubt that your fame has made you rich. Now come and give us of your wealth, for we are in need. \"My friends, \" the hermit replied\", I have nothing but this bed, this mat and this jar of water. Take them if you want. I have no gold or silver. And they looked at him with contempt, and turned their faces, and the last man stood at the door, and cried, Hypocrites! The ambush! You teach and preach what you do not practice. FIN", "title": "El profeta ermita\u00f1o", "author": "Gibr\u00e1n Jalil Gibr\u00e1n"}
