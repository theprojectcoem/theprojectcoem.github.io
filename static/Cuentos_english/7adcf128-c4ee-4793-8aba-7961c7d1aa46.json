Because I had to do it at your house. And he stumbled on the rocks of the Valley of Desolation, and saw a naked young man weeping. His hair was honey-colored, and his body was like a white flower; but his hair was shorn, and like a crown, he carried fire on his head. And Joseph, who was rich, said to the naked young man who was weeping. -I understand how great your pain is, for truly He was right. But the young man replied, -I am not weeping for him, but for myself. I have also turned water into wine, and cured leprosy, and restored sight to the blind. I have stepped into the surface of the waters and thrown the demons that dwell in the sepulchres. I have fed the hungry in the desert, where there is no food, and I have raised the dead from their rotting carcasses, and by my command and in front of a great multitude, a dry hedge has bloomed again. All that he did, I did myself. -Why do you cry, then? -Because I have not been crucified. FIN", "title": "El maestro", "author": "Oscar Wilde"}
