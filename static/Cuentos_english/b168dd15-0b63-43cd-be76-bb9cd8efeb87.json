But it was this ignorance that attracted him to that mirror, for he thought he could recognize his father's face in it. He bought it, amazed, and, without telling his wife, kept it in a safe they had in the attic of the house. From time to time, when he felt sad and lonely, he would go to see his father. But his wife found him very affected every time she saw him come back from the attic, so one day she spent spying on him and found out that there was something in the safe and that she stayed long looking inside him. When her husband left for work, the woman opened the safe and saw a woman whose traits seemed familiar to her but who she could not tell. From there came a great marital quarrel, for the wife said that inside the chest was a woman, and the husband assured that his father was there. At that time a monk who was well respected by the community passed by and saw them arguing and wanted to help them to make peace in their home. The husbands explained the dilemma to him and invited him to go up to the attic and look inside the safe. So the monk did and, to the surprise of the marriage, assured them that in the bottom of the chest who was really resting was a Zen monk.
