Thou wilt hide my law, and I will obey thee for ever. But God didn't answer me, and it went away like a mighty storm. And after a thousand years I went up again to the holy mountain, and spoke again to God, and said, I am thy creature, my Creator. You made me mud, and I owe you everything I am. And God answered not; he went forth as a thousand wings in a hasty flight. And it came to pass after a thousand years, that I went up again upon the holy mountain, and spoke to God again, saying, Father, I am thy Son. Your mercy and love gave me life, and through love and worship to you I will inherit your kingdom. But God answered me not; and he passed away as a mist that covers the mountains. And after a thousand years I went up again to the holy mountain, and called upon God again, and said, My God, my high yearning and my fullness, I am thy yesterday, and thou art my morning. I am thy root in the earth, and thou art my flower in the heavens: together shall we grow in the face of the sun. And God bowed down unto me, and whispered sweet words in my ear. And like the sea, embracing the stream that runs to it, God embraced me. And when I came down to the plains, and to the valleys, I saw that God was there also.
