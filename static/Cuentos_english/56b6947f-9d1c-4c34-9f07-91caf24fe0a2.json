He raises his head and shakes his head a little, but then he is very quiet, watching with his eyes the faint shadow that is following the red girl across the patio. In the room it is cold, and Toby hates the sun rising; he doesn't even like people getting up at that time, and the only exception is the red-haired girl. For Toby the little red girl can do what she is told. He remembers the cola, satisfied to have seen it, and breathes. He is simply happy, the red girl has passed through the garden, he has seen her for an instant, he has followed with his big eyes the shadow on the floor. Maybe the red girl will come back. Toby breathes again, sucks in his head like a spider, puts the pen in the trough, and continues applying the smudge to the third piece of wood.
