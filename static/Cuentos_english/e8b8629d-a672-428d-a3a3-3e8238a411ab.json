No, no! Please!\u201d By saying \u201cNow we use longs!\u201d, he made a long gesture with his right hand, first downward and then parallel to the steel, as if he wanted to invite me to carry a sling. He accompanied the words \u201cDon\u2019t cut!\u201d with another hand motion, his back slamming into mine, at the height of my face and his, to about ten centimeters away, and he stayed there for a second, tilting his head obliquiously forward and looking at me only with his left eye. The expression \u201cPlease!\u201d she replied, instead, abruptly, without making any gesture or demonstrating the indescribable interest whose exclamation the two preceding sentences had so emphasized. It was, however, the one that he preferred, perhaps because of his purely hostile character. But from his words I knew that my new pants were too short.
