One day the magician wanted to go out. Then he placed a bowl of water in the hallway, and ordered his disciples to keep it. He told them not to discover the bowls or see what was inside. As soon as he left, they lifted up the lid and saw that the bowl had pure water and a straw boat with mast and sail. Surprised, they pushed him with their finger. The ship overturned. They quickly straightened it out and covered the bowl again. The magician came and said to them, \"Why have you disobeyed me? The disciples stood up and denied it. The magician declared, \"My ship has landed on the edge of the Yellow Sea. How dare you fool me? One afternoon, a little candle lit in a corner of the yard. He ordered them to guard her from the wind. The second vigil had passed and the magician had not returned. Tired and sleepy, the disciples fell asleep. The other day the candle was off. They turned it on again. The magician came and said to them, \"Why have you disobeyed me? The disciples replied, \"We are not asleep\". How was the light going to go out? And the magician said to them, I wandered fifteen miles in the wilderness of Tibet, and now they are trying to deceive me. And the disciples were afraid.
