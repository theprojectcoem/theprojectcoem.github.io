Ivory sticks cannot be used with bowl and cooked mud plates: they require bowls carved from rhino horns and jade plates, where instead of cereals and legumes, exquisite spices such as elephant tails and tiger fetuses must be served. At this point, the king would hardly be willing to wear dirty fabrics and live under a straw roof: he would commission silks and luxurious mansions. \"I'm worried where this will lead\", Prince Ki said. Indeed, five years later King Chu of the Chang Dynasty ravaged the kingdom to fill his pantry with all the exquisite things, tortured his subjects with falling irons, and got drunk in a lake of wine. And so he lost his kingdom. FIN", "title": "Palillos de marfil", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
