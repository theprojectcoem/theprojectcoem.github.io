Along with the farmer came his little skirt dog, who danced around him, licked his hand and jumped joyfully as best he could. The farmer checked his purse and gave his dog a delicious bite, and sat down to give orders to his employees. The puppy then jumped into her master's lap and stood there, blinking as the master caressed her ears. The donkey, jealous to see that, let loose from his jaquima and began to stand on two legs trying to imitate the dog's dance. The master could not bear the laughter, and the donkey, crawling at him, put his feet on the farmer's shoulders, trying to climb into his lap. The farmer's employees immediately ran with sticks and forks, teaching the donkey that rough performances are not a joke. Jealousy can be very harmful.", "title": "El asno y la perrita faldera", "author": "nan Esopo"}
