That's why he was so loved in Egypt. On a hot summer afternoon, before meeting with the priests to prepare the great New Year's feast, Pharaoh Esnofru thought of distracting himself for a while. He asked for the palace musicians, but they were resting for the night's concert. He looked for the best chess player in the kingdom, but he had returned to the South. What could the pharaoh do now to have fun? Then he asked them to search for the chief of the Dyadyaemanj wizards. And he stood and bowed himself before Pharaoh, and said, What is the Lord of Egypt's service to me? - the magician asked. - What kind of entertainment do you recommend? - the king replied. The magician offered him a boat ride with the most beautiful women in the palace. As they rowed, Pharaoh could see them surrounded by a beautiful landscape full of leafy papyrus and green banks. Pharaoh Snoffrous smiled with satisfaction and ordered the most beautiful boat to be prepared. Snoff, dressed in a simple white skirt, was waiting at the docks when he saw twenty young girls with braided hair and light dresses arrive. And he looked upon one of them, and saw a hanging of turquoise, and he looked down, and said to Pharaoh, My lord, we are ready. They got on the boat and started moving the beautiful golden-plated ebony-wood oars. Esnofru was looking at the main shirt, the girl in the pendant, because she was the most beautiful of them all. The king was happy, forgetting his problems for a while. The magician was right! But... suddenly, they heard a strange sound. Something had fallen into the water. The girls stopped rowing at the lament of the chief shirt who said in anguish: \"What a disaster! My turquoise pendant fell to the bottom of the lake. He was my most precious treasure! Pharaoh offered her a new jewel, but she insisted on the value of her pendant given that it was a gift from her boyfriend. Four of the shirts threw themselves into the water without finding her, and Esnofru decided to return to the palace: \"Isn't it my duty to make my subjects happy?\" he thought. The magician would find a solution. Snoff went into the wizard's lab and thanked him for his great idea. She told him about the lost jewel in her main shirt, asking for his help to recover it. The magician searched the magic books without getting any results. And it was in the House of Life that through reading some hieroglyphics they found a solution. They returned to the place where the turquoise pendant had been lost, while the priest and magician Dyadyaemanj read an ancient formula passed down from sage to sage. Everyone was silent. The magician stood up and, looking at the surface of the lake, he extended his arms. But they were not afraid because nothing could happen to them under Pharaoh. The waters split in two, and at the bottom, without water, the turquoise gem shone. The magician went down to pick her up and gave her to the young woman. Again the waters returned to their place by the magician's order, and they continued to sail happily over the surface of the lake. The news spread throughout Egypt and beyond its borders. The magic of the Pharaoh could work miracles! FIN Anonymous Egyptian", "title": "El fara\u00f3n Esnofru y la joya perdida", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
