He owned a horse, and one morning, when he woke up and went to the stable to feed the animal, he found out that he had escaped. The neighbors came to the village and told him, \"Woe to you! You have a horse and it has gone away\". \"Yes, yes, it is; he's gone\", said the man. A few days passed, and one sunny morning, as the man was leaving his house, he found that at the door was not only his horse, but that he had brought another with him. The neighbors came and saw him and said, 'How lucky you are! Not only have you got your horse back, but now you have two. - Yes, yes, that's right - said the man.
