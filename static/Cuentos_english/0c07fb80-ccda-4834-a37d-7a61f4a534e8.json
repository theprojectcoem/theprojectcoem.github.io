Every moment of the day they ask, \"Do you have the key to the closet?\" - I know. That'll reassure you a little. They keep the key alternately and they become suspicious of each other. The old woman hides it mostly in her chest, between the shirt and the skin. How many things does he not unleash so that he can insert it into the coffers of his useless breasts! The old man sometimes hides it in the buttoned pockets of his pants and others in those of his half-stitched vest, which he often touches. But in the end, those hideouts that are always the same have seemed less and less safe to him, and he has just found a new hideout he feels satisfied with. The old woman asks him, as usual: \"Do you have the key to the closet?\" The old man doesn't answer. - Are you deaf? The old man gestures that he's not deaf. - You lost your tongue? - says the old woman. He looks restless. His lips are closed and his cheeks are swollen. However, his expression is not that of a man who would have suddenly become mute, and his eyes express more picardity than fear. - Where's the key? \"The old lady says, 'Now it's my turn to keep it. The old man keeps his head moving with a satisfied air, with his cheeks about to burst. The old lady understands. He throws swiftly, grabs the old man by the nose, opens his mouth in pairs, puts his right hand in it and takes the key out of the closet.
