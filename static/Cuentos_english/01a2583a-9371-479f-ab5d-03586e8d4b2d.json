Do you not remember when you sat at the window and looked at your twisted roots that lay on the ground? The women come to fill their canoes in the lake and your huge black shadow moves across the surface of the water as the dream debates the moment of awakening. The sun's rays dance on the rippled water, like a swaying string of pearls. Two ducks swim in the grass at the edge of the lake, and the boy sits, contemplative and immobile, to contemplate their shadows in the water. How I would like to be the wind to blow through your swaying branches, to be your shadow to float on the water with the waning day, to be a bird to perch on your highest branch; how I would like to float, like those ducks, between the herbs and the shadows!
