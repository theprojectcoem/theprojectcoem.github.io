He was planning a long pilgrimage to Mecca when he met a spiritual instructor who asked him, \"Why do you have to go to Mecca? - To see God - he replied. \"Give me now your money for the journey, \" the master said. And Bastami gave him the money, and the instructor put it in his pocket, and said, I know that thou shouldest have turned seven times round about the holy stone. Well, instead, he's now going seven laps around me. Bastami obeyed and went seven rounds around the instructor, who then declared: \"Now you have achieved what you set out to do. You can now return home with a calm and satisfied spirit, although first I want to tell you something else. Ever since Mecca was built, not a minute has God lived there. But since the creation of man's heart, not one moment has God ceased to dwell in him. Go home and meditate. Travel to your heart. FIN", "title": "Viaje al coraz\u00f3n", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
