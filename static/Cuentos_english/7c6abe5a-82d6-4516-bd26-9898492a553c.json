A large crowd had gathered at the door. When they got closer they saw a cadet raised and the executioners busy carrying a person already very weak from the dungeon and the tortures to the trench. The common people were crammed around the show. They mocked the prisoner and spat on him, beat him up and waited eagerly for his beheaded. \"Who is this? What crime has he committed? \" the disciples asked one another\". How could the crowd want to kill him so badly?\" No one here shows compassion or cries. \"I suppose he will be a heretic\", said the master sadly. The disciples went on coming nearer, and when they saw the crowd, they asked from left to right, \"Who is this man? What crime has he committed?\" \"He is a heretic\", said the people indignantly. - Hey, what's up? Now tilt your damned head! Let's get this over with! Indeed, that dog wanted to teach us that the city of Paradise has only two doors, when we all know perfectly well that the doors are twelve! The disciples were amazed and asked him, \"Rabbi, how did you know this?\" He smiled and, as he walked again, said in a low voice: \"It hasn't been difficult. If he were a murderer, or a bandit, or any other kind of criminal, we would have seen compassion and compassion among the people of the town. Many would weep and some would even shout into the sky proclaiming their innocence. But those who have a different belief can be sacrificed and their bodies thrown to the dogs without the people being mutated.", "title": "La ejecuci\u00f3n", "author": "Hermann Hesse"}
