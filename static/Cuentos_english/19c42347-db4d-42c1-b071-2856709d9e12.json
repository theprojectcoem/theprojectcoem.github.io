The Zangans claimed them, the bees opposed them. The case went to the court of a certain Wasp: the issue was difficult; witnesses testified that they had seen winged, dark-colored insects flying around those planks, similar to bees; but the Zanganos had the same signs. Mrs. Wasp, not knowing what to decide, opened the summary again, and for further illustration, called for a full ant to testify; but neither could she clear the doubt by those. - You want to tell me what this is all about? - asked a very wise bee. Six months since the trial, we've been on the same page as the first day. Meanwhile, the honey is being lost. It's time for the judge to hurry up; he's had enough of the bargain. Without so many cars and provisions, let's work the Zangan and ourselves, and see who can make such well-finished and rich honey-filled pots. The Zangan did not admit it, proving that the art was superior to their skill, and the Wasp awarded honey to its true owners. That is how all the proceedings should be decided. Moorish justice is the best. Instead of code, common sense. It wouldn't raise the costs so much. It wouldn't happen as it often does, that the judge opens the oyster, eats it, and gives the shells to the litigants. FIN", "title": "Los Z\u00e1nganos y las Abejas", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
