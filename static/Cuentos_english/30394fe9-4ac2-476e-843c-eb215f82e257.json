I'm not weaned yet. - If it wasn't you, I'd be your brother. - I have no brothers, sir. For I am one of your people, for you are all evil against me, your shepherds and your dogs. I know it's good ink, and I have to get back at it. That said, the Wolf rushes him, takes him to the bottom of his woods and eats him, without further car or process.
