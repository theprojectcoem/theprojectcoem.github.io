My motives are as follows: I work as an accountant in a state office and, in the exercise of my duties, I have written a few books, namely: the Inbound and Outbound Book, the Balance Book and the Major Book. Also, in collaboration with the warehouse manager, I've written a fantastic novel called Inventory. I think you'd like them because they're imaginative books and they're funny (they're genuine satires). If I wanted to read them, I could lend them to you, though for a short time, because they are in high demand. Who's more interested is the Treasury Inspector, I can already hear your voice in the next office. Speaking of the inspector, I predict I'll have certain expenses because I'm afraid the books won't be pleasing to you. I am writing you this letter precisely so that the prize will allow me to vote for you. Please send the turn at my address. I'll leave a permit in my wife's name, in case I'm not home the day the mailman comes. In that case, the money will be used to pay the lawyer or... wait a minute, Mr. Nobel, the inspector just came in. He's already gone. You know what I'm saying, Mr. Nobel? You better send me two prizes. You have no idea how prices have skyrocketed. FIN", "title": "Carta para Suecia", "author": "Slawomir Mrozek"}
