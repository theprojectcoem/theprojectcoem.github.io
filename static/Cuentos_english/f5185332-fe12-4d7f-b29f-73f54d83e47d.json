The grains came out of the stem from the top to the ground: the whole stem was thorns. But men are like them, forgetting their blessings in abundance, and they become careless and frivolous. And a woman was passing by a field of wheat; and her little son, who was with her, fell into a pit, and defiled his garments. The mother pulled out a handful of beautiful spikes and used them to clean the boy's crotch. When our Lord saw him passing by, he was indignant and said, \"From now on the thornbush will not sprout thorns, for men are not worthy of the gifts of heaven\". When the crowd heard this, they were terrified and fell on their knees and begged the Lord to leave some grain in the stall. If they were not worthy, he would do so, at least for the innocent hens, who would otherwise die of hunger. The Lord, seeing their misery, was moved with compassion and granted their request. And so the spike was left on top, as we see it today. \u266a Finish \u266a", "title": "La espiga de oro", "author": "Hermanos Grimm"}
