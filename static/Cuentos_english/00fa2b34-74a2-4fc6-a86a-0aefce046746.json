At one end were the tips of my feet; at the other, my hands, held tight to the brittle point, I clapped my teeth, affirming myself. The skirts on my jacket were flame-throwing at my sides. In the depths the frosty stream of trout was rumored. No tourist was cheering up to those impassable heights, the bridge wasn't on any map yet. So I lay there and waited; I had to wait. Every bridge that has ever been built can stop being a bridge without collapsing. It was once toward the sunset--I do not know whether the first and the thousandth--my thoughts were always confused, they always turned round; toward that summer sunset; when the stream murmured darkly, I heard a man's passing. I'm with you. Stretch a bridge, build a bridge, beam without railings, hold the one entrusted to you. He shall level his way unnoticed; if he stumble, let him know, and set him on a firm ground, like a god of the mountains. He came and hit me with the metal tip of his stick, then he lifted up the skirts of my coat with it and put them over me. The tip of the stick snapped between my tangled hair and held it there for a long time, while I looked probably with wild eyes around it. It was then - I dreamed of him over mountains and valleys - that he jumped, falling with both feet in the middle of my body. I trembled in the midst of a wild pain, ignorant of what was going on. Who was it? A child? A dream? A road jumper? A suicide? A tempter? A destroyer? I turned around so I could see him. The bridge is turning! I had not finished turning, when I was already hurrying, I was hurrying and I was already torn and stuck in the pointy pebbles that had always looked at me so gently from the fast water.
