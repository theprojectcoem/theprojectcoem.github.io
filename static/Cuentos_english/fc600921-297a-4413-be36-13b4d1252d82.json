I remember the first day I covered my arms with these jasmines, with these white jasmines. I have loved the light of the sun, the sky and the green earth. I heard the crystal murmur of the river in the darkness of midnight. In the course of a road, the autumnal twilight has come to my encounter, like a bride removing her veil to receive her lover. However, my memory is still scented with those first white jasmines I had in my hands as a child. Life has given me many happy days and nights of fun; I have compared my laughter to the laughter of the happy guests. In the grey and rainy mornings, I have sung slow songs. I have hung the vespertine shawl of babes, knit by the hands of love. However, my heart is still perfumed with the memory of those fresh jasmines, the first to fill my hands as a child.
