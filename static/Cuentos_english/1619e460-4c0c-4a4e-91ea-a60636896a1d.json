Peter came with the keys, opened the door and sent the master in. He did not see the man, but he shut the door and left him outside. From there he heard the rich man's joyful reception in heaven, with music and songs. When all was quiet, St. Peter finally came back and sent the poor man in. He hoped that the songs and songs would resume, but everything continued silently. They welcomed him with great joy, and the angels went out to meet him, but no one sang. He asked St. Peter why there was no music for him as for the rich man, or if it was that in heaven there were the same differences as on earth. \"No\", replied the saint, \"we deserve the same respect as each other, and you will get the same share as the one who has just entered the delights of Paradise; but look, poor people like you come here every day in the hundreds, while rich people like the one you just saw enter barely one century after century.
