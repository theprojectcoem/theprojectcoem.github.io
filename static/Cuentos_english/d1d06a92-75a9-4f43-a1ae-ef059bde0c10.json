Later a thirsty goat came to the same well, and seeing the fox asked if the water was good. She, hiding her real problem, gave herself praise for the water, claiming it was excellent, and invited the goat to come down and try it where she was. Without further thought the goat jumped into the well, and after quenching his thirst he asked the whore how they would get out of there. And the fox said, \"There is a way that is certainly our mutual salvation. Lift thy front feet against the wall, and lift up thy horns, and I will come up upon thy body, and once I am out, I will throw thee. He believed the goat and so he did with good taste. The fox cleverly climbed on her companion's back and horns, managed to get out of the well, and immediately walked away from the shore, not fulfilling the promise. And the goat came to him, and said, Behold, my friend, if thou hadst been wise, and hadst not gone down, and thought not how thou shouldest go forth afterwards. Before you commit to anything, think first of whether you could get out of it, regardless of what your neighbors have to offer you.", "title": "La zorra y el chivo en el pozo", "author": "nan Esopo"}
