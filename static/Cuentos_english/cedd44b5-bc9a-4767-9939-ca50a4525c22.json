He cleaned every sentence, every twist of voice, every silence. He was rehearsing handshakes, gestures, steps. He was able to repeat a word a thousand times until the sound reached perfection. And meanwhile he refused to welcome anyone, to talk to anyone. He was afraid that others would corrupt his style, infect him with their triviality, their clumsy diction, those rustic modulations that people speak with. Finally, when he decided that he had nothing left to learn, he left his home, headed to the agora, and gave his first speech in the presence of the crowd.
