Three had reached the limit of what men can know, but they lacked sanity. The other disdained knowledge; he only had common sense. One day they met. What good are the clothes, they said, if we don't travel, if we don't get the favor of kings, if we don't make money? First of all, let's travel. And they went a little farther, and the chief said, One of us, the fourth, is a simple man, and he is not but a man of his mind. Without knowledge, with mere sanity, no one gains the favor of kings. We will therefore not share our profits with him. Get him back to his house. And the second said, My clever friend, thou hast no wisdom. Go back to your house. The third said, 'This is not the way to do it. We've been playing together since we were kids. Come, my noble friend. You'll have your share of our profits. They went their way and found the bones of a lion in a forest. And one of them said, It is a good occasion for us to exercise our knowledge. Here's a dead animal; let's bring it back to life. The first one said, \"I can make the skeleton. The second said, \"I can supply skin, flesh and blood. The third said, \"I can give him life. The first one composed the skeleton, the second one supplied the skin, the flesh and the blood. The third was about to infuse life, when the wise man observed: \"It is a lion\". If they resurrect him, he's gonna kill us all. - You're very simple, the other said. I will not be the one who frustrates the work of wisdom. \"In that case\", replied the wise man, \"I'll wait for you to climb this tree. And it came to pass when he had done this, that they resurrected the lion; and he rose up and slew the three. The wise man waited for the lion to get away to get off the tree and back home.
