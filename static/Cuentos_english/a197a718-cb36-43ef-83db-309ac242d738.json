As fist-stepping paths cross and multiply, and the two fighters only to win take care of each other, a third thief approaches, grabs the donkey, and marches. Sometimes the donkey is a poor province; they are princes, thieves, of Transylvania or Turkey, perhaps Hungarians (three are offered and not two in my view, because this bad merchandise was always abundant), most often none of them is the stolen province; another thief arrives, and among them he restores harmony, keeping the donkey for himself by right of conquest.
