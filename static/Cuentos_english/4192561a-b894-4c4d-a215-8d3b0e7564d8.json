I saw once that Rome and the Palace of Letran hung from a silk fig; that a man without feet won the race to a fast horse; and that a very sharp sword cut a bridge. I saw a silver-nosed butterfly chasing two fast-moving hare, and a wide tilo growing hot cakes. I saw an old, dry mother-child who gave her good one hundred cubes of butter and sixty of salt. Enough of these lies, or not yet? For I saw a plow ploughed without horse or ox, and a one-year-old child throwing four millstones from Regensburg to Treveris and from Treveris to Strasbourg, and an azor swimming down the Rhine and making it as if it were in its element. And I heard a noise in the sky of fish, and I saw flowing honey as sweet as water from a deep valley to a high mountain. It's weird all this, isn't it? There were two fat people cutting a lawn, and I saw two mosquitoes building a bridge, two pigeons tearing a wolf, two children mating two goats, and two frogs trampling grain. I saw two mice consecrate a bishop, and two cats scratch the tongue of a bear. He came running a snake and slaughtered two wild lions. There was a barber shaving a woman's beard, and two hare dogs dragging a mill out of the water, and an old lady was looking at him, saying he was fine. And in one courtyard, four corks were grinding grain with all their might, two goats were lighting the oven, and a red cow was putting bread into it. Then a rooster sang: Quiquiriqui! The story goes all the way here! FIN", "title": "El cuento de los desprop\u00f3sitos", "author": "Hermanos Grimm"}
