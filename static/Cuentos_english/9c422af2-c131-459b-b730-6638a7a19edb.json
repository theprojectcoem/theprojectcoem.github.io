Each of them got a plot of land where they could retreat to meditate in peace. One of them had the idea of planting a rose and having roses, but he immediately rejected the purpose, thinking that the roses would cause him attachment and would end up chaining him. The other guy had the same idea and planted the rose tree. Time has passed. The rose blossomed, and the man who owned it enjoyed the roses, meditated through them and thus raised his spirit and felt unified with Mother Nature. The roses helped him grow inwardly, awaken his sensitivity, and yet he never clinged to them.
