He was resting against the door facing the floor. And he never paid attention to her. One day a man from the city, a man of science, passed by his house. And, warning the statue, he asked the owner if he would sell it. - Who wants to buy that horrible, dirty statue? - replied the owner, laughing. \"I'll give you this silver for it\", said the man from the town. The other was stunned, but pleased. The statue was moved to the city on the back of an elephant. And after several months the man from the hills visited the city and, as he walked down the streets, he saw a crowd before a business, and a man who shouted in a loud voice: \"Come and behold the most beautiful, most wonderful statue in the whole world. Just two pieces of silver to admire the most extraordinary masterpiece. At once the man from the hills paid two pieces of silver and went into the shop to see the statue that he himself had sold for a single piece of that same metal.
