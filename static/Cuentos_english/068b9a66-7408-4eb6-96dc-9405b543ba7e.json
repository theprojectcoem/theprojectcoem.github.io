I am the king of thousands of monkeys. I have great power. The Buddha kept the noble silence. He smiled. The monkey king was shamelessly arrogant and fatuous. \"Don't hesitate, sir\", he added, \"I am the strongest, the fastest, the toughest and the most skilled. That's why I'm the monkey king. If you don't believe me, test me. There's nothing I can't do. If you want, I'll travel to the end of the world to prove it to you. The Buddha remained silent, but listening attentively. And the king of the monkeys said, \"I'm going to the ends of the earth now, and then I'll come back to you\". And he left. Days and days of travel. He crossed seas, deserts, dunes, forests, mountains, canals, steppes, lakes, plains, valleys... finally, he came to a place where he found five columns and, along the same lines, only an immense abyss. He said to himself, 'There is no doubt, this is the end of the world.' Then he began the return journey and again he traveled through deserts, dunes, valleys... finally he came back to his place of origin and found himself facing the Buddha. - You've got me here already, he said arrogantly. You've seen, sir, that I am the most fearless, skilled, resilient and skilled. That's why I'm the undisputed monkey king. The Buddha merely said, \"Look where you are. The monkey king, stunned, realized then that he was in the middle of the palm of one of the hands of the Buddha and that he had never come out of it. He had reached to his fingers, which he took as columns, and beyond felt the abyss, out of the hand of the Blessed One, which he had never abandoned.
