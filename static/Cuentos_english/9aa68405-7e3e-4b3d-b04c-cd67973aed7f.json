After a while he went to visit the bride with the horticulturist, and asked her about her situation. She said, \"Everything is wonderful with me, but I do have a special desire for the rain every day, abundantly, so that plants can always have enough water. A few days later she visited her other daughter, also asking about her condition. \"I have no complaints, \" she replied\". I only wish that the day would be dry, without rain and with sunshine, so that the bricks would wither and become very hard. The father pondered: if one desires rain, and the other dry, which of the two will I attach my desires? Never try to please and get along with everyone. It's impossible for you.", "title": "El padre y las dos hijas", "author": "nan Esopo"}
