Give me a news report from Budapest. Unfortunately, it was exhausted. Give me one of yesterday, then. It's over too. But I happen to have one tomorrow. Is that where the movie poster is? That comes out every day. \"Then give me the one tomorrow\", said the material mobilizer. He sat back in his car and looked for the movie theaters. After a while he found a Czechoslovak movie  The Loves of a Blonde  about which he had heard praiseworthy talk. It was shown at the Cueva Azul cinema on St\u00e1cio Street, starting at five and a half. Just in time. It was still a little bit short. He kept browsing the paper the next day. He was struck by a news about material displacer J\u00f3zsef Pereszl\u00e9nyi, who, with his Wartburg car registration CO 7514 was travelling at a speed higher than allowed by St\u00e1cio Street, and not far from the Cueva Azul cinema collided head-on with a truck. The careless driver died on the spot. \"Who would have thought\", thought Pereszl\u00e9nyi. He looked at his watch. It'll be five and a half soon. He kept the newspaper in his pocket, started at a faster than allowed speed, and crashed into a truck on Stasius Street, not far from the Blue Cave cinema. He died on the spot, with the newspaper the next day in his pocket. FIN", "title": "El conductor", "author": "Istv\u00e1n \u00d6rk\u00e9ny"}
