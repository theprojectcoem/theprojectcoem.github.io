The god moved with compassion, appeared to him and asked him the cause of his grief. Once informed of everything, he presented the woodcutter with a gold axe and asked if it was the axe he had lost, but he replied no. Then he showed him Mercury a silver axe, and told him if it was the one he had lost, but he replied that it was not either. Then she showed him one of iron, which the woodman saw, said to be his. God, knowing in this his goodness and virtue, rewarded him with the three axes. The woodcutter, full of joy, told his companions about the event, one of whom wanted to try his luck, and going to the river dropped his axe on him and began to weep. Mercury appeared to him and asked him why he was crying, after he explained the cause, he presented him with a gold axe, and asked him if it was the one he had lost. The man answered, \"Yes, and the god knew his deceit, so he did not give him the gold coin or return his own. God is gracious to the good, but severe to the wicked.", "title": "Mercurio y el le\u00f1ador", "author": "nan Esopo"}
