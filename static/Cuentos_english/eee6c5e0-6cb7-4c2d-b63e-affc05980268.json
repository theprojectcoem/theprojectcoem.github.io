The other soldiers accept it, but some (not all) feel something foreign in it, as if it were a foreigner or a foreigner or a foreigner. This rejection will impede less than the interest of the retrenchers. It is not better, but it is usually eaten on Saturdays. It has the habit of a tea, which can somehow ward off loneliness. Women don't want it and he doesn't want it. He has a son in Dolores. For years he knew nothing about it, like the simple people who do not write. He is not a man of good conversation, but he always tells, always with the same words, that long march of many miles from June to San Carlos. He often tells it with the same words, because he knows it from memory and has forgotten the facts. He has no cloak. He lies on the bed and does not know what the weight is. He has the calm consciousness. It has been limited to fulfilling orders. Enjoy the trust of your leaders. It is the degreaser. He has forgotten the times he has seen the white sand in the desert. He has forgotten the cliffs, but he will not forget the first and the visions that the plain has given him. They will never rise above it. You don't have to call attention. In his province he was a king. He is no longer able to ride a horse, but he likes horses and understands them. He is friend of an Indian.
