And a monkey pulled the cock and pu-pu!, he kicked and went out in all the whirlwind, until they got rid of the fear and started putting wood and wood in it, but as the machine had no water, when they pulled the lever, he threw himself croaking down a road and broke a pu! And all the monkeys flew through the pitch and got caught in the tails on the highest branches of the sticks. And the Culachite said to him, \"Give him a word\". And Chepete said to him, \"Geno\". And he nodded and started to cough. FIN Stories of the chip, 1945 / 1961", "title": "El cuento del cuento que contaron", "author": "nan Salarru\u00e9"}
