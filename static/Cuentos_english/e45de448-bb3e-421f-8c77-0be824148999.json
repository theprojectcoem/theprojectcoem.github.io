The guy that was there a long time, sitting there with his pencil and his paper, drawing Minerva drunk while she danced with the velvet girl. I went behind him to see how the portrait was coming out and I didn't like it because this one he's painting isn't Minerva. Look at the face of this one, and she's got no chest or belly as down as Minerva. Do you realize that? And as a woman like that had just made a doll, I touched it on the shoulder and said, \"Baby, paint me this down here\". It was a joke, see? The guy slapped me, and I, who can't stand punches more than Marota, hit him with a bottle. Tell the cop that guys like that, who don't understand the environment... tell him it was self-defense!
