When he opened it, he found it contained gold. He sat down and started counting the money. A rich landlord passing by stopped to see the gold. Where did you get that? He asked. I found him on the river bank. - All right. Be careful, this area is infested with thieves. They'll cut off your head to steal your gold. Maybe I could come back with you and put the safe in my safe, would you? Very relieved, the tramp accepted the offer. But the next day, the rich man denied any knowledge of the fortune. The vagabond dragged the thief to the courthouse, where Nasrudin was then acting as a judge. Where are the witnesses? He asked the tramp. Woe to me: there is none! \"The man answered. I found him by the river when there was no one around. Then go to the river and tell him to appear in court. The man was totally surprised, but he went to talk to the river. A few hours later, he still wasn't back. Do you think it'll take too long? The judge asked. \"It could take a long time\", replied the wealthy owner. That stretch of river is a long way off. Finally the wanderer returned, heated and angry: \"I asked the river to come until I was tired of repeating it, but it did not move. \"Yes, he did\", Nasrudin said. While you were on the way, he came in for a moment and told me that this man \"added, pointing to the landlord\" is indeed a thief. FIN", "title": "Testigo", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
