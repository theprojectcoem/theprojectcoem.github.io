When the appointed day came, the impostor took a little bird and hid it under his cloak. He went to the temple. Facing the oracle, he asked if what he had in his hand was a living being or was it inanimate. If the god said 'animate', the man would show the bird alive; if he said 'alive', he would teach him dead after he had hung him. And the god saw the evil intent of his heart, and said, Let thy deceit be, wicked man; for thou knowest that it is in thy hand whether it be dead or alive. The divine power is not to lead you astray.", "title": "El p\u00edcaro", "author": "nan Esopo"}
