The astute fox, for her best menu, had a slender broth, for she lived poorly, and presented it to the stork served on a shallow plate. This one couldn't taste a single sip, because of its long spike. The fox, on the other hand, licked everything in an instant. To avenge that mockery, the stork decided to invite a bitch. \"Delighted\", he said, \"I'm not a protocol with my friends. When the time came, she ran home to the stork, finding the dinner served and with an appetite that the lady foxes never lack. The smell of the meat, broken into thin pieces, excited her even more. But to his dismay, he found it served in a cup of high neck and narrow mouth, through which passed perfectly the stork-do\u00f1a beak, but the whore-do\u00f1a snout, as it was of greater measure, did not reach to touch anything, not even with the tip of the tongue. So, bitch bitch had to go fasting, all embarrassed and deceived, with her ears gaffed and tailing. To you, crooks, I write: You expect the same fate! Do not deceive others, for they know your weaknesses well and will make you pay for your harm in the way that will most affect you.
