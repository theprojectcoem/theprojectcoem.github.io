Under the bridge was a huge caldera where human heads were shivering. Over them soared eagles that tormented them with their talons. \u2014That is the eternal torment that there is in the other world. What else have you seen? \u2014Then I passed by a village where cheerful songs and laughter were heard. I wondered, \u201cWhy is this joy?\u201d They told me they had had a very good harvest, and that they were living in abundance. \u2014They are the people of God: they are ready to give food to all the world; no poor man would leave his house without being well fed. \u2014Then I saw two women fighting on a road. I wanted to separate them, but I couldn't. \u2014They were two nuers. What happened after? \u2014In another village, I saw tears and sadness. \u201cWhy are they so sad?\u201d I asked. And they said to me, \u201cBecause the border has spoiled our fields, and now nothing remains.\u201d \u2014There is where people live who do not know sincerity. \u2014Then I saw two pigs fighting. I wanted to separate them, but I couldn't. \u2014It is about brothers who do not agree. What more do you see? \u2014I was in a wonderful pasture. I could be there for three days without moving, observing such beauty. \u2014It is paradise in the other world; but it is hard to get there.
