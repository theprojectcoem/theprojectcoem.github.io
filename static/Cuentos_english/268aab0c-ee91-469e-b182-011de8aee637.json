The girl went to the forest and met an old woman who, knowing her misfortune, gave her a scent that she could only say to her: \"Ollita, cook so that she can make a rich sweet piss pie\", and saying to her: \"Ollita, stop cooking\". The girl took the pot home to her mother, and so they were free from poverty and hunger, and ate as much cake as they wanted. When the girl came out, the mother said, \"Oli, cook, and the olli cooked and she got tired of eating\". Then she wanted the olli to stop cooking, but she didn't know the formula. So the smell kept cooking and the dough came out of the edges and kept cooking, cooking, and flooded the kitchen and the house next door, and then the street, as if to satiate the whole world, creating a difficult situation for which no one could find a remedy. Finally, when there was only one house left, the girl came back and said, \"Ollita, stop\". The smell stopped cooking, but anyone who wanted to go back to town had to eat some pasta to make their way. \u266a Finish \u266a", "title": "La papilla dulce", "author": "Hermanos Grimm"}
