Zeus, in response to their request, sent them a thick piece of wood to his pond. Frightened by the sound of the falling wood, the frogs hid wherever they could. Finally, seeing that the wood was no longer moving, they came out to the surface. Given the prevailing silence, they began to feel such great contempt for the new king, that they jumped over him and sat on him, mocking him without rest. And so, feeling humiliated for having a mere woodman as their monarch, they went back to Zeus, asking him to change the king for them, for he was too quiet. Indignant, Zeus sent an active water snake to them, one by one, which trapped and devoured them all without mercy. When choosing a ruler, it is better to be simple and honest than an entrepreneur but wicked or corrupt.", "title": "Las ranas pidiendo rey", "author": "nan Esopo"}
