All their happiness consisted in resting their heads on the shoulders of their mother; nothing in the world would let them see her. The child\u2019s wisdom is expressed in simple words. How few can understand its meaning! If not, he has his reasons. What you want most is to learn your mother tongue from the same lips as your mother. So adopt a so innocent air! Despite his wealth of gold and diamonds, the child came to this land as a beggar. He had his reasons for coming with this mask. Little, naked and pleading, if he pretends to be an indigent it is to claim to his mother the immense treasure of his tenderness. In the country of the rising moon nothing entrapped the freedom of the child. If he gave up his independence he had his reasons. He knows very well that that little nest, the heart of his mother, contains an inexhaustible joy, and that the sweet embrace of the mother's arms is infinitely sweeter than freedom. The child didn't know how to cry. She lived in the land of perfect happiness. They had all the reasons to start spitting. The cries of his mother are mixed with the smiles of his sweet face, but it is the little cry that arises from his childish cries that binds them together in the double strand of faith and love.
