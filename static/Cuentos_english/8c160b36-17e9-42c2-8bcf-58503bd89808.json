She took him and brought him home, and then she begged the gods to transform him into a little girl, and grace was granted her. And after some years, seeing that the girl was of age to marry her, he said to the young woman, Choose of all nature the being that thou wilt; I promise thee that thou shalt marry him. \"I want\", said the young woman, \"a husband so strong that he can never be defeated. \"It's the sun, then, what you want\", said the brahmin. And it came to pass the next day, that she said to the sun, My daughter desired a husband that was invincible; will thou take her for thy wife? And the sun said to him, The cloud destroys my strength; go to it. The Brahman asked the same question to the cloud. \"The wind\", said this one, \"makes me go wherever it pleases me. And the old man was not discouraged; and he begged the wind to take his daughter for his wife; and the wind told him that his strength was held by the mountain. And he said to the mountain, The mouse is stronger than I, for it pierced me round about, and went into my bowels. The old man went looking for a mouse, who agreed to marry his daughter, saying that he had been looking for a wife for a long time. The Brahman, when he entered his house, asked his daughter if she wanted to marry the mouse and she accepted, since the mouse beat the mountain, which held the wind, owner of the cloud that hides the sun. The good man said to himself, \"To get to this end, what was the point of changing the mouse into a girl?\" And she prayed to the god that the young woman would return to her primitive mouse state, grace she got.
