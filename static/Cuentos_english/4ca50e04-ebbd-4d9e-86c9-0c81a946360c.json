If he had woken up without him, the child would have cried out to his mother. But the beauty of the sun's rays has opened up in his own eyes a florid and magical paradise that he has been awaiting. And the child sways, and laughs, and makes great conversations without words, even me, taking both hands to the feet and writhing in delight. He puts his hand to the sun; then, the foot - with what difficulty and what patience! - then the mouth, then the eye, and he wakes up, and laughs, closing his eyes and filling his swollen mouth with baba. If in the struggle to play with him one hits the barbed wire, one averts the pain and the cries and laughs with tears that complement in beautiful irises the beautiful sun of the ray. The instant passes and the ray of light goes from the child, little by little, wall up. Even the child, shivering, looks at it as an impossible butterfly, indeed for him. Soon, the ray is gone. And in the fourth dark, the child - what does the child have, say all the currents, what will he have? - cries despondently for his mother.
