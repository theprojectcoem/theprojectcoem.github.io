One morning he dressed elegantly, and looked in the mirror. Who's more beautiful? He asked his wife, Mr. Xu, from the northern city, or me? \"You are so beautiful\", his wife replied, \"how can Mr. Xu compare to you?\" But since Mr. Xu of the northern city was so famous all over the country, for all the good looks, Zou Ji didn't believe his wife at all. He repeated the question to his concubine. How can Mr. Xu compare to you? \"I'm going to get you\". Later that morning, a visitor came and Zou Ji asked him the question. \"You are by far the most beautiful\", replied this man. The next day, Mr. Xu came in person. After careful analysis, Zou Ji was convinced that Mr. Xu was much better looking than he was. He studied in front of the mirror and he didn't doubt that he was the more common of the two. That night, in his bed, he came to the following conclusion: My wife says I'm the most beautiful, because she flatters me. My concubine says it out of fear. And my guest claims it because he needs something from me. FIN Anchronicles of the Warring States, 1st century BC", "title": "\u00bfQui\u00e9n es el m\u00e1s hermoso?", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
