The boat that is anchored by a load of ginger and cotton on a branch will sail again with the stem full of pistachio and poppy seed, and the caravan that has just unloaded coastlines of nutmeg and grapevine grapes will be relaying its wings for the return with golden muslin rolls. But what drives you upriver and across deserts to come here is not just the barter of goods that you always find the same in all bazaars inside and outside the Great Kan empire, spread at your feet on the same yellow carpet, in the shadow of the same scary canvases, offered with the same deceptive price cuts. Not only do people come to Euphoria to sell and buy, but also because at night, beside the bonfires around the market, sitting on bags or barrels or lying on piles of carpets, at every word one says - like lobo, hermana, treasure hidden, batalla, sarna, amantes - the others tell each one their story of wolves, sisters, treasures, scabies, lovers, battles. And you know that on the long journey ahead, when to stay awake in the sway of the camel or the junco you begin to evoke all your own memories one by one, your wolf will have become another wolf, your sister a different sister, your battle in another battle, on your return from Euphoria, the city where memory changes at each solstice and at each equinox.
