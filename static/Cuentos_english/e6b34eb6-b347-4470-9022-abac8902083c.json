What can I do for you? - A fluke, sir. It is only a reward of 150 doubles which you must discount me immediately. Mr. Colbert, who perfectly realizes that the character was mocking, asks him for permission to finish dinner and, so as not to get impatient, begs him to sit at the table with him. \"I'd love to\", replied the gask, \"excellent idea, because I haven't had dinner yet. After the meal, the minister, who has had time to warn the chief, tells the officer that he can go up to the office, that his money is waiting for him; the gaskons go up... but he is not given more than a hundred doubles. - You want to joke, sir? - he tells the official. Or don't you see my order says 150? \"Sir, \" the scribe replied\", I see perfectly what you are saying, but I will give you fifty times the price for dinner\". -Pardiez, fifty doubles! If it costs me only ten wages in my inn! - I believe you, but you don't have the honor to dine with a minister there. \"Perfect\", replied the gask, \"in that case, sir, save everything; tomorrow I will bring one of my friends and we are at peace. The reply and the joke which had provoked him made the court laugh for a while; the fifty doubles were added to the gratification of the gascon, who returned triumphantly to his land, praised the dinners of Mr. Colbert of Versailles and how the genius of the Garona was rewarded there.
