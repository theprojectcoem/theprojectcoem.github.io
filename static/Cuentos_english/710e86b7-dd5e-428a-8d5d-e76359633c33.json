I was sure a lot of people would pass by the town. But the town had become famous for an unusual event: a man who had been sleeping continuously for more than a quarter of a century. No one knew the reason. What a strange event! People passing by the village always stopped to gaze at the sleeper. - But what is the cause of this phenomenon? - the visitors were wondering. A hermit lived near the village. He was a hurricane man, who spent the day in deep contemplation and didn't want to be disturbed. But he had gained fame for being able to read other people's thoughts. The mayor himself went to visit him and begged him to go see the sleeper for if he could find out the cause of such a long and deep sleep. The hermit was very noble and, despite his apparent wit, lent himself to try to collaborate in clarifying the fact. He went to the village and sat down next to the sleeper. He concentrated deeply and began to direct his mind toward the clairvoyant regions of consciousness. He introduced his mental energy into the sleeping brain and connected to it. Minutes later, the hermit was back to his normal state of consciousness. The whole town had gathered to hear him. In a quiet voice, he explained, \"Friends. I have come, yes, to the central concavity of the brain of this man who has been asleep for more than a quarter of a century. I have also penetrated the tabernacle of his heart. I've been looking for the cause. And, to your satisfaction, I must tell you that I have found it. This man dreams continually that he is awake; therefore, he does not propose to awaken.
