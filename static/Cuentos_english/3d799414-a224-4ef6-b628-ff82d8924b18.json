He is said to have been the first king of Egypt, until the day when disaster fell upon him. Seth was jealous of Osiris, his brother. During a party, he challenged the guests to enter a safe. Osiris entered it and the lid closed... Osiris fell into his trap! And Seth threw the coffin into the Nile and seized the throne. Isis, the wife of Osiris, found her husband's body and hid it. But the evil Seth took hold of him, cutting him this time into fourteen pieces, which he scattered in the Nile stream. After a long search, the witch goddess Isis recovered the pieces and patiently joined them together. With the help of Anubis, the god of embalmers, he brought Osiris back to life, who became the god of the dead in the Most High. Isis never met her husband again on earth! However, there was revenge. His son Horus, the falcon-headed god, fought Seth in a terrible battle, defeating and reconquering his father's kingdom.
