Suddenly they came to a stream that was flowing very deep, and there was no bridge or passageway to cross. The bride, neither short nor lazy, went up her skirts, ready to wade the stream; and behold, when she was already in the center, the witch of the line, who stood near, began to shout in a mocking tone:  Eh!
