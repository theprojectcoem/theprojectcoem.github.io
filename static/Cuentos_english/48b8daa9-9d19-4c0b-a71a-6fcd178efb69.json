Then innumerable flowers open from the dead; no one knows where they have come from, and they are seen dancing wildly on the grass. Mother, I am sure the flowers have a school under the earth. When they have done their duty the door is shut, and if they want to go out to play before the time is up, the teacher sends them to the corner. Have vacations when it comes to rainy season. The branches intertwine in the forest and the leaves are strewn with the fierce wind, the gigantic clouds give a handshake and the flower-girls come running, with their pink, yellow and white dresses. You know, mother? Flowers live in the sky, like the stars. You haven't decided what you want to do up there? And you know why there is so much impatience? I know, I know who their arms are pointing to: the flowers have, like me, a mother. FIN", "title": "La escuela de las flores", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
