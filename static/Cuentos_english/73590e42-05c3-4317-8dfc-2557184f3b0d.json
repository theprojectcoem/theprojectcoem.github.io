The king asked him if he knew how to do something, the foreman replied that he knew how to play the harp and tell stories. He threw out old names, spoke of Gudrun and Gunnar, and finally referred to Odin's birth. He said three stalls came, that the two first ones promised him great happiness, and that the third one said, cynically: -The child will live no more than the candle that is burning by his side. Then the parents shut the door so that Noah would not die. Olaf Tryggvason described the story, the preacher repeated that it was true, took the candle and lit it. While they were watching her burn, the man said it was late and he had to go. When the glass was gone, they sought him. A few steps from the king's house, Odin had died.
