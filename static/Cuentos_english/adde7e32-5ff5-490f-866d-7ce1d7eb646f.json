And the prophet made a cedar tree grow before the gate of the palace, so thick and so high that no cord could round it, nor reach the end of its cup; and he put a beautiful room on its top, into which no man could go up. The king was so amazed at this miracle that he believed in Zoroaster. But then four envious magicians asked the royal doorman for the key to the prophet's room while he was away. They put in their books bones of dogs and cats, and nails and hair of dead people. They went to the king and accused him of being a sorcerer and a poisoner. The king sent the doorman to open the room for him, and, finding the words, sentenced the messenger from heaven to hang. When the king's most beautiful horse was about to be hanged, a strange accident occurred: his four legs were put into his body. The prophet solemnly promised to cure the horse in exchange for forgiveness. And he accepted his offer, and took a leg out of his belly, and said, Lord, I will not take the second leg out, unless thou promise me to embrace my religion. \"I promise you\", replied the king. The prophet made the second leg of the beast appear and then demanded that the monarch's sons also convert. Finally, the appearance of the remaining two legs managed to make numerous proselytizing in the court. They drowned the four wicked magicians instead of the prophet and all Persia embraced the religion of Zoroaster.
