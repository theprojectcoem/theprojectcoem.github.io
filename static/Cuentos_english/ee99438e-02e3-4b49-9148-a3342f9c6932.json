He asked about them, and some answered, \"No. \" Others turned away from him. I always ended up finding them and going up another floor. The fact that the stairs were often weak, heavy, and narrow strengthened their faith. On one floor there was a city, with squares and streets well-planned. It was snowing, it was falling at night. Some houses - all of them small - were lit up with live lights. Through the windows I could see men and women of two feet in height. He couldn't stay with those dwarves. He discovered a wide stone staircase, which took him to another floor. This was a front room, where servants, in white jackets and bad manners, cleaned tea sets. Without turning around, they told him there were more floors and he could go up. He arrived at a terrace with vast twilight parks, beautiful, but a little sad. A woman, dressed in red velvet, looked at him in horror and ran across the huge landscape, shaking her hair, groaning. He understood that all those who lived there were crazy. He could go up another floor. In a ship's own architecture, which included white-painted woods and iron, he found a snail ladder. He went up to a hill over it where the pearls were, which gave the hot water to the floors below. He said, \"The sky is above the fire\". And he took a cane, hoping to climb higher. The pipe folded; there was a steam exhaust, which rubbed his arm. This discouraged him from continuing to climb. He thought, \"I'll burn myself in the sky\". He wondered which of the horrible lower floors I should go down. In all of them he had felt out of place. This did not prove that he was not the proper abode, for hell is precisely a place where one thinks he is out of place.
