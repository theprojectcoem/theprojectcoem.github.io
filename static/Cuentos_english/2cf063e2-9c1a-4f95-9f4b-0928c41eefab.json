He never has a deadline, he is not obligated to follow any path or to arrive at any place, or to return, or to return at a certain time. How I would like to be a seller and spend the day on the streets shouting: - Glass, glass, glass! When, at four o'clock, he returns from school, he contemplates the verdure of that house as the gardener waters the garden. He works as he pleases with his ax, his clothes are full of dust, no one cares if he burns in the sun or gets wet in the rain. How I would like to be a gardener and a sailor, a sailor forever without anyone coming to interfere with me! At night, when my mother puts me to bed, I see through my open window the watchman, who walks up and down the street. The trough is narrow and is solitary, the frog swells up like a giant with a single and huge red eye. The vigilante makes his lantern whirl as he walks, his shadow walks with him and never, never will he sleep. How I would like to be a vigilante and walk the streets all night, and make the shadows run with my lantern! FIN", "title": "Vocaci\u00f3n", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
