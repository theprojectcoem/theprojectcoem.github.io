At the home of the Marquess of Ely, in Hove, near Brighton, London, a ghost has made its mysterious appearance which is not so mysterious because it is a ghost as it is an exclusively photogenic ghost. In his private apartment, the young marquis - 25 years old - took the photo of a friend with artificial light, convinced that he was alone with her. But the photograph revealed that the marquis was wrong: besides them, there was a ghost in the room. A ghost that no one has known personally except in photography, and which consequently no one can say what it really is, since there is no evidence that the conflicting, original and modernized spectrum is the same or at least similar to his portraits.
