They began to bite it with their eyes and point their fingers at it. One of them went down to take the cup, but the other pushed him and said, \"Let's see who it belongs to\". The first one who saw her will swallow her up, the other one will look at her. \"If that's worth it\", replied the comrade, \"I have very good eyesight, thank God. \"It's not bad either\", replied the first, \"and I tell you I've seen the oyster before you. - Well, if you saw it, I smelled it. They were these days and nights when Don Picapleitos arrived and they took him for a judge. Don Picapleitos severely opened the oyster and swallowed it in front of the litigants. And when he had tasted it, he said to the presiding officer of the court, Take, the court shall give to each of you one shell; go in peace. Consider the costs of litigation today; calculate what is left to the parties; you will see how don Picapleitos leaves all the grain and leaves the litigants nothing but straw.
