One day a lion cub was born in a neighboring place, but this one was orphaned. And the king called his visitor, a wise and intelligent fox, and said to him, What sayest thou, if we bring the orphan and bring him up? And the fox thought, and said, My lord, I have never pityed such orphans. Either you're friends or you're destroyed before they're strong. But the lion king did not heed these advice and had the little lion brought to his territory. As time went on, the king grew older and the little lion became stronger and ravaged the entire region, killing greatly. Claims came from all over the world that the young lion was causing damage; food was given to calm his fierce appetite, but it was uncontrollable. The lion king soon realized that he should have listened to the fox's advice and thus avoided big problems. A foolishness that brings about a fatal outcome is to let the seed of evil thrive.
