Isis wondered how she could force the sun god to reveal his most secret name. He decided to wait for a good opportunity, and he began to watch closely. When Ra fell asleep, Isis took the opportunity to collect the saliva from the god and mix it with some earth, which she used to form a dangerous snake with the intention of biting the god. Isis placed the animal on the path Ra was going to pass through, so the snake attacked him. Ra shouted a terrible cry of pain and the venom of the snake began to invade his being, unable to fight him and not knowing where it came from. The other gods, mourning, watched him suffer. Then the witch goddess Isis came up to him and said, \"Tell me your secret name and I'll heal you\". Ra started to say several of his names: Creator of heaven and earth, Architect of mountains, Flood Controller... But he never even got to say his secret name. His pain from the bite was so severe that he ended up agreeing to one condition: that Isis and her son Horus would not reveal it to anyone. Isis cured Ra by using a magic formula and applying an ointment made from herbs. And that's how the goddess Isis got to be as powerful as the Sun-god Ra.
