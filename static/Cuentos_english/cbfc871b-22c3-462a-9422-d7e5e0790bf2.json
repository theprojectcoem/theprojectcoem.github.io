Now he is dreaming, Terah said; and knowest thou not what he is dreaming? Oh, how you know! \"Alice\", she said. No one could have guessed! He's dreaming of you! \"Tara\" he cried, clapping his hands for his victory. And if I stopped dreaming about you, what do you think would happen to you? \"Because I would still be here so quiet, of course\", Alice replied. That's what you'd like, Tarara replied, \"with great satisfaction\". You wouldn't be anywhere! You're nothing more than something he's dreaming about! If he woke up, Tarari added, you would turn off... Like a candle! That's not true! \"Alice exclaimed indignantly\". Besides, if I were anything more than what he's dreaming about, I'd like to know what you are! That, that! \"Tarrari said. You said it! \"Tara\" he exclaimed. So many voices were coming out, Alice couldn't help but say, \"Fuck you! If they keep making that much noise, they're gonna wake him up. \"That should be seen; what you are, it is of no use to you to talk about waking him up\", said Tarari, \"when you are only an object of his dream\".

If I wasn't real, Alice continued, half laughing through her tears, I couldn't cry like I'm crying. Come on, you two! You won't think those tears are real! Tarari interrupted with the greatest contempt. \"I know they're saying nothing but nonsense\", Alice reasoned to herself, \"so it's a foolish thing to make me cry\". So she dried her tears and continued to speak in the most joyful and carefree tone she could. Alice through the mirror, 1871", "title": "El sue\u00f1o del rey II", "author": "Lewis Carroll"}
