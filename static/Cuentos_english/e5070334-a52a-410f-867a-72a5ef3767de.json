He received, redeemed, delivered, wrote down, stamped, sealed, signed, counted and returned. He did everything with perfect calmness, without the slightest nervousness and always kind, courteous, smiling non-stop to neighbors, customers, security guards, the whole world, to all things, to himself... to his workday. First of all, his job, which the employee judged a very tedious task, but he endured thanks to a little strictly personal obsession. For the employee has, in fact, for ten years been committing what is called a daily crime every night before he leaves, a gesture that has become compulsory, a reason to live. Every night he puts a randomly chosen deck of cards in his suitcase. He takes them, returns home as soon as possible, throws the cards on the table, opens them anxiously and every night, from nine o'clock until dawn, he answers them one by one, without forgetting one, without writing a word lightly.
