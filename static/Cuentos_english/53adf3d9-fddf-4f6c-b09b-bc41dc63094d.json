It was too cold to sleep in the field, so they called the door of a house. The peasant let them in, on condition that the next day, early, they would bring him several hundred sacks of grain. By morning, the master called them. The apostles rose up and were ready to go into the age. But Ivan the Merciful persuaded them to sleep a little longer. The peasant waited a while, then took a stick, entered the trough and began to give sticks to the one who was standing near. It was Ivan the Merciful, who cried: \u2014Enough! Let's go! The peasant walked away. The apostles began to rise up. But Ivan the Merciful again persuaded everyone to relax a little more. But he said, \u201cLet\u2019s see if this peasant comes back and puts a punch in the first one,\u201d and he hid behind the others. The peasant waited for a reply, turned to the pillar with the stick and thought, \u201cWhy do I have to hit the same person? I will smite the one behind all.\u201d And he began to give a beating to the one behind him. The peasant walked away, convinced Ivan the Merciful a third time to the apostles not to rise, and stood in the middle of everyone. The king waited, but the king's brethren did not come. He returned to the ark with the lance. He entered and thought, \u201cWell, the one ahead has already received his reward; the one behind, too. I will now give it its due to what is in the middle.\u201d And again Ivan the Merciful received the lancets, who, now yes, asked the apostles to come and help the peasant. FIN 1.
