She says dirty things to teachers, doesn't cut her hair, doesn't shave, wears glasses and stains the walls. He's a bad student, but he's done with his classes. He doesn't obey his parents. When he is rich, he is a little-bitter; being poor, he lives like a pig. Sleeping until 12:00, you go to bed at an indefinite time. He writes with flaws. Nature brought him into the world for love alone. He never opposes drinking until he loses his sense; after getting drunk at night to the green devils, he gets up excited, with a hardly noticeable weight on his head, without needing the similia similibus curantur [the similar cures the similar]. He marries without intention. He fights with his mother-in-law forever. He's fighting with the kin. Lie to the crazy. He loves scandals and amateur shows. In the orchestra, it's the first violin. Being light, he's liberal. Either you don't read anything at all, or you read with passion. He likes newspapers, and he's not against being a little journalist himself. The comic book mailbox has been invented, exclusively, for the bloodthirsty. It's constant in its unstable state. In the service, he's a special assignment officer, or something. In the gym, she teaches literature. He rarely serves as an active civilian adviser; if he serves until that point, he becomes flamboyant and sometimes angry. The cranes, the bribe, and the tuners are bloodthirsty. Sleeping in a room with a bloodsucker is not recommended: tell jokes all night and, if there are no jokes, censor your loved ones or lie. He dies of digestive disease and premature exhaustion. FIN", "title": "El sangu\u00edneo", "author": "Anton Chejov"}
