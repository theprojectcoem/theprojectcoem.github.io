I stopped, blinked, I didn't understand anything. Nothing: I didn't understand the reasons for things, of men, everything was nonsense, absurd. And I laughed. The weird thing about me was I never noticed it before. And that until that moment I had accepted everything: traffic lights, vehicles, signs, uniforms, monuments, those things so separated from the world's meaning, as if there were a need, a consequence that united them.

I'm sorry, I answered. Maybe I was wrong. I thought so. But everything is fine. I'm sorry, and I opened my way between rough eyes. Yet even today, whenever I do not understand something (often), I instinctively have the hope that this time it will be the good one, and that I will again understand nothing, to acquire that different wisdom, in a moment found and lost.
