That work was a scenario, for confusion and wonder are God's own operations, not man's. With the passing of time a king of the Arabs came to his court, and the king of Babylon (to make fun of his hostage) made him enter into the labyrinth, where he walked mingled and confused until the afternoon. Then he cried to God for help and gave up the door. His lips did not speak a word, but he told the king of Babylon that he in Arabia had another labyrinth, and that if God was served, he would let him know it some day. Then he returned to Arabia, gathered his captains and his avalons, and sacked the kingdoms of Babylon with such a vengeful fury that it destroyed their fortresses, broke their kings, and made the same king his enemy. He threw him on a chariot and took him into the desert. They walked three days, and he said, \"Oh, king of the time and substance and number of the century!, in Babylon you wanted to lose me in a labyrinth of bronze with many steps, doors, and walls; now the Powerful has had it well with him to show you me, where there are no steps to climb, no doors to force, no tedious hallways to walk, no walls to see the way.\" Then he cut off his ties and left him in the middle of the desert, where he died of hunger and thirst. The glory is with the one who does not die. FIN El Aleph, 1949", "title": "Los dos reyes y los dos laberintos", "author": "Jorge Luis Borges"}
