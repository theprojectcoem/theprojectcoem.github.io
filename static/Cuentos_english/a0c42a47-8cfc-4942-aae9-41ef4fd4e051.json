Isis and Horus were hiding when Seth found them and locked them up. When evening fell and with the help of Thot, god of justice and truth on earth and in heaven, they escaped from his prison. During their journey, he sent seven magical scorpions to guide and protect them. After a long journey through the land of Egypt, they arrived in Per-Sui, a city where crocodiles are worshiped. Isis and her son arrived very tired and eager to rest. They saw a house near the marshes where, at the door, a very rich woman named Usert stood. And he saw the seven scorpions that were with them, and he refused to help them, and shut the door of his house to them; but they found a resting-place, for a poor woman had kindly received them into her house. The scorpions, however, were very angry at the rich woman's attitude, and decided to teach her a lesson for her lack of charity. They gave all their poison to their boss, Tefen, who entered the rich woman's house and thus bit her sleeping son. The woman began to cry for help, but no one came to her aid. However, the goddess Isis ran out to help her. She took her child in her arms and ordered the deadly poison by her words to come out of her little body, thus saving her from death. The woman named Usert realized that Isis, the Lady of Magic, whom no one had previously thoughtfully refused to host, had saved her son's life. He felt such remorse that he offered all his fortune to Isis and the poor woman of the marshes who offered her house without fear.
