Why does the sun have to be more beautiful than electric lamps? If you told me why, maybe I would like it. How much they frighten you with the horror of the nymph, so wooden!, and the trolls stealing from the car. Only the train... the train. This was the horizon that he saw in his life of exile. The train came over him and all his fear turned to pride. He waited, trembling, begging, begging the frenzied and trembling arrival from far. The train suddenly rounded the curve and was making a huge turn. Soon, it sat upon him, being already the size of the whole universe. In this way, the boy who was faithful to his urban origins and preferred death to exile from the machines and narrow streets and the great halls of the factories lit with white, electric, squares of light against the black. They would have killed the soul, little by little, with the sun and the landscape. The abomination of oil slicks in the odious nights of such silence! If they had told him that the sun is an enormous electric light bulb, he might have laughed. But it is that no one understands children. FIN", "title": "Un cuento", "author": "Fernando Pessoa"}
