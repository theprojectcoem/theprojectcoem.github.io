Yeah, looks like she was armed with plastic modules, like a window sill. They say he has no face. Factions, of course, he doesn't have. Where's the nose, for example? No one's ever seen her. They say not even Ramon. Every morning she sits in front of the mirror and invents her face, paints her like someone painting a dead nature, for example, or a portrait... then, of course, Ramon has put her up piece by piece so she can, well, I don't know, bathe, and stuff like that. Sometimes you see Ramon for weeks without Sylvia. One asks him about it and he replies that he's in Cappadocia posing for Vogue; it's very Cappadocia-fashioned now. We'll all be going. Raimunda and Ricardo are planning a charter. But it's a lie that he's in Cappadocia. Sylvia has never been beyond Tarrasa. It's because you're bored with her and not the gun and not the paint. She keeps all the pieces in a special box: during those weeks Ram\u00f3n rests and she too; that's why she's so incredibly young, because during those weeks she spends kept and unarmed time doesn't pass for her. Then when Ramon starts missing her again, he reassembles her and they go out together everywhere. FIN", "title": "La invenci\u00f3n de Ram\u00f3n", "author": "Jos\u00e9 Donoso"}
