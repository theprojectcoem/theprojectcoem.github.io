Etelvina resigns because she trusts that they will find each other in Heaven. She waits, waits... She waits for God to call her. Now she is an old lady. You are passing through the Plaza of your neighborhood. Soon - in the twilight the angel's bells ring- he sees Luis among the trees, who approaches slowly. (It is not Luis: it is a young man from the neighbourhood very similar to the memory Etelvina has of Luis.) Etelvina sees the young Luis and is sure that he, in turn, sees her as young. \u201cThis square, you think, although it looks much like the one in the neighborhood, has to be a square of Paradise.\u201d And they will certainly meet there, for, at last, what happiness! she just died. The cry of a bird brings her back, and she dies again. FIN", "title": "Una plaza en el cielo", "author": "Enrique Anderson Imbert"}
