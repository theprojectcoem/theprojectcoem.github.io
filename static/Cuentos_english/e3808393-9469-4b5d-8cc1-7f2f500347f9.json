Destiny will separate us, and our love will be forgotten. I know it would be too clever to think I can buy your heart with my gifts. Your life is still young, your way long. Be babies of the tenderness we offer you, then turn around and go from our side. You have your games and your friends, and I understand that you do not give us your time or your thoughts. But age gives us an opportunity to remember the days gone by, to re-find in our hearts what our hands have lost forever. The river runs fast and breaks, singing, all obstacles that come its way. But the mountain in the sky sees him pass with love and keeps his memory. FIN", "title": "El regalo", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
