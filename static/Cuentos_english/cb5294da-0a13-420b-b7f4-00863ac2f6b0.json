Desiring to take hold of that meat, he began to flatter the raven. He praised his elegant proportions and great beauty; he added, moreover, that he had not found anyone better endowed than himself to be the king of the birds, but that he was affected by the fact that he had no voice. The raven, to show the fox that she had no voice, let go of the meat to proudly shout loudly. The fox, without wasting time, quickly grabbed the meat. And he said to him, My raven, if thou hadst knowledge, and had understanding, thou wouldst be king over the birds. When you're flattered, you should take care of your possessions.
