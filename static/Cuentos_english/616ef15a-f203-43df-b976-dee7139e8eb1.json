No one knows what time Mother Wang lived, but the old people say she was a woman who made and sold watermelon. A Taoist monk used to go to his house for a credit drink. The tavern apparently paid little attention to the delay in payment: the monk would present himself and she would serve him immediately. One day the Taoist said to Mother Wang: \"I have drunk your drink, and since I have nothing to pay you for it, I am going to dig a well. When the well was finished, they realized it contained a good watermelon. \"It's to pay my debt\", said the monk, and he left. From that day on, the woman had no need to watch. He served his customers the liquor he extracted from the well, far better than the one he previously made with fermented cereal. His clientele increased tremendously. In three years he made a huge fortune of tens of thousands of ounces of silver. Suddenly, one day the monk came back. The woman thanked him effusively. - Is the whiskey good? - the monk asked him. - Yes, the whiskey is good, he admitted. It's a shame, since I don't make the watermelon, I don't have any more cereal shells to feed my pigs! Laughing, the Taoist took the brush and wrote on the wall of the house: The depth of the sky is nothing, the human heart is infinitely deeper. The well water is sold for water, but the woman complains that she has no pig skin. After his quartet, the monk left, and only water came out of the well.
