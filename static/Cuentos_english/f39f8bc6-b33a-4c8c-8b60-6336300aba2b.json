On a prepared Turkish rug was the roof, and my reader can be sure that the rats found it pleasing. The society was certainly honest, splendid in gift and juicy; but someone to disturb came the party at the best of the story. I hear that from the living room to the entrance strange and suspicious rumor, and zap! The Rat ran away from the village and ran after her. As soon as the rumor had ceased, they returned our rats to their company, and as the hostess sat down, in a mellow tone: \"We'll finish our roast\", he said. \"Enough\", replied the peasant girl, \"I beg you to come home tomorrow, and don't suppose you're arrogant and vain and I'm trying to make you a finer breakfast; but there's no one to interrupt me. As to my taste; for me charms pleasure has not, if it may be bitter any fear. FIN", "title": "La rata de la villa y la del campo", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
