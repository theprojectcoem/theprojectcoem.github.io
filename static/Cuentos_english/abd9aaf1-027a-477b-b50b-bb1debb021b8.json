And your dog invited another friend dog, too. \"Come to my house for dinner with me\", he said. And the guest dog came in full of joy. And he stood, and beheld the great feast, and said in his heart, What an unexpected fate! I'll have enough to eat and not be hungry for several days. In these thoughts, he waved his tail like a great old trusted friend. But seeing the cook moving happily from there to here, he grabbed him by the legs and, without thinking about it any more, threw him out the window. The dog turned around and began to roar. On the way he met other dogs, and they asked him, \"How much did you eat at the feast, friend?\" \"I've been so drunk from so much drinking\", he replied, \"I don't even know where I've gone. Don't trust someone who gives you what doesn't belong to him.", "title": "El perro y el cocinero", "author": "nan Esopo"}
