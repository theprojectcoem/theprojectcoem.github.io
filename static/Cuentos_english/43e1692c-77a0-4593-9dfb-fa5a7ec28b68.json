By a miraculous coincidence, just as the killer was getting rid of the jawbones of the angry husband (while several curious people were closing a circle around the group), a half-crazy Italian, who lived in the house nearest the scene, was accidentally hit by a bomb he was preparing, and instantly the street became a pandemonium of smoke, flying bricks and people running. The explosion did not hurt anyone (though it put out of combat Colonel Lacour), and the lady's vengeful lover fled among the crowd, and lived quietly the rest of his days.
