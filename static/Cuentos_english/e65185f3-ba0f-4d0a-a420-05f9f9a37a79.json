When she says it, everyone smiles, but they keep quiet and dare not deny it. On a summer's day, a woman invites her friends to the beach. At noon, the Caribbean moves away from the group talking in the sand, to walk, feet in the water, along the breakwater. The water is warm and the sun burns her shoulders and reverberates on her long wet legs. The woman slowly enters the sea. When he no longer stands, he dives his face with his eyes open and looks, blurred in the gloomy green and salty, white corals, blue anemones, slow-wave algae and two fish crossing like two yellow butterflies. Then he turns his back, the sun on his face, and swims with perfect arms toward the reef that is still not seen. The sea envelops her in a mysterious wavelength of life, the sun imposes its heat on a world where she is the lonely center. The next day the woman begins the long oblique journey to her country, where she enters months later with dyed hair, a fake passport and her addresses learned from memory, to rejoin a guerrilla already doomed to annihilation. A week later an Army patrol finally breaks into a suburban house that has resisted the siege all night long, until the defenders ran out of ammunition. He finds three dead men and, shrunk in a corner, with his useless weapon, the woman, unharmed, breathing slowly and looking with empty eyes at a dark green, far away, where yellow butterflies pass. Without resisting, they take her by the arms, tie her back with wire, and walk out of the house. The sun is burning like on the beach, even if it's the one on the plateau. The woman is beginning to join both memories, smiling, when the officer fires a sharp bullet into her chest.
