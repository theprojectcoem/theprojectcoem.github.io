And so, from this ocean, comes Amun-Ra, the sun god, fatherless and motherless. It was born out of the ocean. The first god has been born. He appears on the top of a hill coming out of Nun and spits out Shu, god of the air, and Tefnut, goddess of humidity. And together they beget Geb, the god of the earth, and Nut, the goddess of heaven, and Geb and Nut beget the other gods of Egypt. This is how the universe is born. But the ocean Nun does not disappear, but it surrounds the sky. The Egyptians fear that it will flood the land. So, in the face of this fear that this situation causes, they represent this ocean in the form of a sacred lake next to their temples. Once the universe is in place, men must be born, who will later become pharaohs. The Egyptians considered the lamb-shaped god named Jnum to be the creator of men. In his potter's workshop he shaped the human body, and also his soul, especially concerned with training the future pharaohs, and giving them their ka, that is, their life energy.
