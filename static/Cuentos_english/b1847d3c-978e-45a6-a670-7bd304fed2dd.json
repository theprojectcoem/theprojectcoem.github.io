My room is dark with a vaguely white wall. Outside there is a triumph as if nothing exists. Only the clock keeps on ticking. And this little thing of a twig that is on top of my table encompasses the whole of the earth and the heavens... I almost lose myself in thinking what this means, but I come back and I feel myself laughing in the night with the smirks of my lips, because the only thing that my watch symbolises or signifies, filling with its smallness the enormous night, is the curious sensation of filling the enormous night with its smallness... And this sensation is curious, because it is only for me for who fills the night with its smallness. FIN", "title": "Reloj", "author": "Fernando Pessoa"}
