Now the night is dark, and I call her: \u2018Come, my treasure, the world is asleep; if you come for a moment, while the stars are looking long, no one will know\u2019. The trees were shedding their leaves and spring was young when she went. Now everything has bloomed abundantly, and I call her, \u2018Come, my treasure. Children grow and spread flowers in their hands filled with the joy of endless games. If you come to take a single flower, who will protest?\u2019 Those who were playing then are still playing. What a generous life! I hear your cries and I call you: \u2018Come, my treasure, the heart of your mother is bursting with love, and if you come to steal a single kiss, no one will ever claim it.\u2019 FIN", "title": "La llamada", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
