And it came to pass one day, as he was working in the field, and lamenting his lot, that a little dwarf came and said unto him, Good man, I have heard thy lamentations, and I will change thy fortune. Take this chicken; it's so wonderful that every day it lays a golden egg. The dwarf disappeared and the Labrador took the chicken to his barn. The next day, oh surprise! he found a golden egg. She put it in a basket and took it to the city, where she sold the egg for a high price. The next day, mad with joy, he found another golden egg. Finally, fortune had entered his house! Every day I had a new egg. So little by little, with the proceeds of the egg sale, he became the richest man in the region. But a foolish greed took hold of his heart and he thought, 'Why wait for the hen to lay an egg every day? I better kill her and I'll find the gold mine she's in. And so he did, but inside the chicken he didn't find any mines. Because of his greed, this foolish countryman lost his fortune.", "title": "La gallina de los huevos de oro", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
