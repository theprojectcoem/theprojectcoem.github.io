But Marta, you're getting crazier every day, why bring that chicken? And Martha said simply, \"We haven't eaten chicken in a long time\". Against the feminine logic you can do nothing, you thought, and yet your masculine logic forced you to say it would have been better to buy it dead, peeled and eviscerated, don't count on me for that I have sleep and I'm going to sleep. And you went to sleep and just now, with twelve gloomy bells, you're gonna wake up wondering who's gonna kill that stupid animal. And you're gonna go in and say, Marta, who's gonna kill that stupid animal? But Marta's not by your side. Marta, what the hell are you doing, woman? Full moon light enters through the open window in pairs. You get up to close it and then look for Martha inside the house but no, you won't need to look for her because there, in the middle of the garden, among the innocent margaritas, is your wife slaughtering the trembling bird and lifting it up too high so that the blood falls on her eyelids, on her forehead, on her cheeks, to penetrate between her open lips, to slide over her neck, over her shoulders, over her breasts; there is Martha covering herself with black feathers, Marta first chanting and clumsily imitating a flight to anywhere, to everywhere, to nowhere, to an unknown distant sabbath from which she never participates.
