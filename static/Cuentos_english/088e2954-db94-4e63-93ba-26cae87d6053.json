But after the rush, no one thinks about what is offered to heaven; we only think about what we owe to earth. Jupiter, says the wicked, is a tolerant creditor; he never sends us to the sheriff. What more sheriff than thunder? What name do you give to those warnings? Surprised by the storm, a sailor offered a hundred oxen to the victor of the titans. The thing was, he didn't have a single ox, and he would have had the same trouble promising a hundred elephants. When he was on the beach, he burned some bones, and the smoke went up to Jupiter's nostrils. And he said, Lord God, take my vow; the perfume of the ox that is slain breatheth upon thy holy majesty. Smoke is your part; I owe you nothing else. Jupiter pretended to laugh, but a few days later he took revenge, sending him a dream to reveal that somewhere there was a hidden treasure. Our man ran to find it; he came across robbers, and having in the bag nothing but a shield, promised him a hundred talents of gold, well counted, from the treasure he sought and that was in such a buried place. The thieves were in the area, and one of them said to him, \"You are mocking us, my friend. Die and take your hundred talents to Pluto\".
