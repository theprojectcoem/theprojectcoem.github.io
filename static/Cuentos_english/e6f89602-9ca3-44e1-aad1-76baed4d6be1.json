To that end, a group of them had to travel from their hometown to the other where the event was to take place. To cover the journey, the scholars took the train and got a compartment for themselves. Nothing but settling into the compartment began to talk about the mind and its mysterious mechanisms. The train started. They all gave their opinions and came to a common and shared conviction that the most necessary thing was to cultivate and develop mental attention. \"Yes, nothing is more important than to stay alert\", one of them emphatically declared. - It requires the methodical cultivation of attention - another one was demanded. \"You have to apply yourself to attention training; that's the essence\", some said. So they spoke and spoke without ceasing about the need to be alert, watchful and perceptive; about the convenience of settling into a full and awake attention. The convoy was following its monotonous march. But a track was in poor condition and the train derailed without the driver being able to avoid it. The train rushed through a huge ravine, making countless laps, until it finally stopped crashing into the depths of it. The scholars continued to polemicate bitterly, insisting on the need to raise the threshold of attention to the maximum, but none of them had noticed the accident. They declared that one had to have a mind so attentive that not even the flight of a fly would go unnoticed. They were still passionately debating mind and attention, with their bodies piled on top of each other, all ignorant of the peril. FIN", "title": "Los eruditos", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
