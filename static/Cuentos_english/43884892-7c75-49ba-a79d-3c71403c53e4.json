Built at the dawn of time, by a race whose tower-shaped tombs and high-domed cities now constitute a single dust with that of their builders in the slow evolution of the desert, they stand to contemplate the terrible after-dawns, which arise in other countries, consuming the veils of the night in the infinite desolations. At the same level of light, their fearsome eyebrows retain the pride of the Titanic kings. In his stone-faced, unforgiving, eyeless gaze, the despair of those who have looked to the infinite for too long is reflected. Mountains like the mountains from whose metallic breast they sprang, their lips have never recognized the sovereignty of the suns that in triumphant flame ride from horizon to horizon through the subjugated land. Only at sunset, when the west burns like a gigantic furnace, and the distant mountains cast golden sparks into the depths of the heated skies - only at sunset, when the east becomes infinite and indefinite, and the shadows of the desert mingle with the shadow of the night to form a single one - then, and only then, rises from its stone throats a music that rises to the covered horizon; it is a loud and sad, strange and loud-sounding music, like the singing of black stars, or the letan of gods who invoke oblivion; it is a music that enters the desert by reaching its rock-like tomb, and that retweets in the great pit of oblivion, until the last of the joy of which destiny, a black trumpet echoes, reaches its heart's infinite silence.
