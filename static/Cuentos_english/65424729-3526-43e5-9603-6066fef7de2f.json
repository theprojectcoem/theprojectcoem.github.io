The walls, the terracottas, the gardens, the labyrinths, the steps, the terraces, the ante-rooms, the doors, the galleries, the circular or rectangular patios, the cloisters, the cruciforms, the alcoves, the antecamaras, the chambers, the rooms, the libraries, the squats, the kilns, the unfinished chambers and the hypogees, are no less costly than the sand grains of the Ganges, but their number has a limit. From the azotes to the poniente, it does not matter who divides the herring-houses, the breweries, the palatines, the distilleries and the slave-yards. No one is given to walk more than a tiny part of the palace. Some do not know but the solitary. We can hear faces, voices, words, but what we hear is nothing. a definite and beautiful at the same time. The date that the steel is engraved on the slab and that the parish books record is after our death; we are dead when nothing touches us, not a word, not an adage, not a memory. I know I'm not dead.
