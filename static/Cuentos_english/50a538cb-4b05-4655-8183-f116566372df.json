It occurred to me that perhaps the fire had broken out in my house. Previously, the thought that my manuscripts might be lost would have shattered my whole being; but I noticed with double horror that the possibility that fire might have broken out in my house left me indifferent, almost happy at the thought that, by destroying those manuscripts, my life would be simplified. Previously, the loss of my manuscripts, of the most precious fragmentary work of my life, would have driven me mad; now I already contemplate it as an acrid incident of my destiny, not as a mortal blow capable of annihilating my own personality by annihilating its manifestations. Then I began to understand how I had come to be exhausted by all the continuous striving for the unattainable perfection, and I understood the great mystics and the great ascetics, who recognize in the soul the futility of life. What would they say about me in those written papers? He would have said, \u201cAll\u201d; today he would say, \u201cNone,\u201d or \u201cLittle,\u201d or \u201cSomething Strange.\u201d He had turned his back on me. But I couldn\u2019t tell whether I had found or lost myself with this. FIN", "title": "Una lecci\u00f3n", "author": "Fernando Pessoa"}
