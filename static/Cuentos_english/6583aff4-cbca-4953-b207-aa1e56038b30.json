He was speaking to his disciples about the Supreme Being and the individual being, explaining that they are the same thing. He declared: \"As the Supreme Being exists within himself, so it exists within each of us. One of his disciples said to him, \"Teacher, how can we be like the Most High, when he is so great and mighty?\" Infinite universes dwell within him. We're particles next to him. The sage asked the disciple to approach the river Ganges and draw water. The disciple took a jar of water and presented it to the wise man. \"I asked you for water from the river Ganges, \" he replied. \"This cannot be water from the river\". \"Of course it is\", said the dismayed disciple. - But in the Ganges there are fish and turtles, cows come to drink at its banks, and people bathe in it. This water cannot be from the Ganges. \"Of course it is\", insisted the disciple, \"but in such a small quantity that it cannot contain fish, turtles, cows or devotees. \"You're right\", said the wise man. \"Now put the water back into the river. The disciple did so and came back to the wise man. \"Isn't all this water now?\" he asked. The individual being is like water in a bowl. It's one with the Supreme Being, but it exists in a limited form and that's why it looks different. When he returned the water from the bowl to the river, he again had fish, turtles, cows and devotees. If you meditate properly, you will understand that you are the Supreme Being and that you are in everything, like Him.
