During the night the wind had unleashed it and thrown it to the ground, no doubt. Tiennette is sanctified and raises Christ with all precautions, as if he were a still living person. You can't put it back on the cross that's too high; but you can't leave it alone, either, on the side of the road. Plus, he's broken down from falling and missing several fingers. \"I'll take Christ to the carpenter to fix it\", they say. He grabs him by the waist and takes him away, without running. But it is so heavy that it slides between her arms and is often forced to lift it with a violent shaking. And each time, the nails that once held the feet of Christ grab Tiennette's missing, lift her up a little and let her legs show. - He wants to be quiet, sir! - He tells you. And with all simplicity, Tiennette gives a soft slap on the cheeks of Christ, gently, respectfully.
