But, no longer able to do so, he leaves the load on the ground, tired and in pain, and begins to think about his bad luck. What pleasures have you had since you came into the world? Is there anyone poorer and miserable than he in the roundness of the earth? Bread is often lacking, and rest always: the wife, the children, the soldiers, the taxpayers, the creditors, the neighbor's burden, form the exact painting of the rigor of their misfortune. He calls Death, comes quickly and asks what he's offered. - Help me to get back to my job and my years, after all, you can't take long. Death cures everything, but we're good here. Before suffering than dying, it is the man's uniform. FIN", "title": "La Muerte y el Le\u00f1ador", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
