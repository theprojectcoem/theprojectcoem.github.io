It was built with huge stones brought from the hills above on the back of the mules of Antioch. When the bridge was finished, it was engraved on the pillar in Greek and Aramaic: This bridge was built by King Antiochus II. And all the people crossed the good bridge over the gentle river Assi. One evening a young man, considered by some to be a madman, went down to the pillar where the words had been engraved, covered them with coal and wrote above: As they pass over the bridge they are riding on the hips of the Antioch mules, who built this bridge. When the people read what the young man had written, some laughed and others marveled. \"Oh, yes\", said one, \"we know who did this. Isn't he a little crazy? But one mule said, laughing, to another mule, \"Don't you remember that we really carried those stones? And yet, until now, the bridge was said to have been built by King Antiochus.
