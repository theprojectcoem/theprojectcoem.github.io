I said to my father, \"I'd like to take them and tame them. My father had often explained to me that it is a crime to put birds in a cage. But this time, tired of repeating the same thing, he found nothing to answer. A few days later I said again, \"If I want to, it'll be easy\". At first I'll put the nest in a cage, hang the cage on the cherry tree, and the mother will feed her chicks through the bars until they no longer need it. My father didn't tell me what he thought of this system. So I put the nest in a cage, hung the cage on the cherry tree, and what I had planned happened: the parents, without hesitation, brought their little ones their crawling spikes. And my father, funny as I was, watched from afar the birds come and go, their feathers colored red with blood and sulfur yellow. One afternoon I said, \"The little ones are pretty strong already. If they were free, they'd fly. They spend one last night with their family and tomorrow I'll take them home, hang them from my window and there will be no better caregiver in the world than these. My father didn't say otherwise. The next morning, I found the cage empty.
