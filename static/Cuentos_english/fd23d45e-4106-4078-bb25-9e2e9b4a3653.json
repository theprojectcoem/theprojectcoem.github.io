So Solomon began making a rope. A devil came up to him and asked him what he was doing with that rope. \"Because you try to learn too much\", Solomon replied, \"you're going to be older than your grandfather Satan. You'll see! When the rope was ready, Solomon began to measure hell with it. The devil came back, and asked him why he was taking action. 'It is that, in this place, I will build a monastery,' said the wise Solomon. And, in that, a cathedral. The devil was frightened, ran and told his grandfather Satan everything, who hurriedly drove the wise Solomon out of hell.
