One of them had been enormously wealthy, and even after he had severed family and social ties and quit his business, his family cared for him and had several servants to look after him. The other sadhu was very poor, lived on public charity and only owned a shield and an antelope skin to meditate on. Often, the poor sadhu boasted of his poverty and criticized and ridiculed the rich sadhu. He used to make the following comment: \"He looks too old to keep up with the family business and then he's quit, but without giving up all his luxuries\". The poor sadhu never missed an opportunity to bother the rich sadhu and mock him. He would come up to her and say, \"My resignation is valuable, not yours, which really does not represent any kind of resignation, because you still live a comfortable and easy life\". One day, suddenly, the rich sadhu, when the poor sadhu spoke to him like this, said sharply: \"Right now, you and I are going on pilgrimage to the fountains of the Ganges, like two wandering sadhus. The poor sadhu was surprised, but in order to maintain his image, he had to agree to make a pilgrimage that he really wanted very little. Both sadhus set out. A few moments later, suddenly, the poor sadhu stopped and, alarmed, exclaimed: \"My God! His face reflected anxiety. - Why? - I don't know. - asked the rich sadhu. - Because I forgot to take my shield and my antelope skin. And the rich sadhu said to him, \"You have mocked my material goods for a long time, and now it turns out that you depend much more on your shield and your skin than I do on all my possessions.
