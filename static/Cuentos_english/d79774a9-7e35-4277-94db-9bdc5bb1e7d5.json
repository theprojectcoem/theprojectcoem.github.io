He, driven by good and charity, went to the marketplace. There he saw in a corner a group of people staring at an object on the ground, and he came closer to see what might draw their attention. It was a dead dog, tied around his neck by the rope that had dragged him through the mud. Never was anything more vile, more repugnant, more unclean offered before the eyes of men. And everyone in the group looked down on the floor with displeasure. \"This stuff is blowing the air\", said one of the people present. \"This rotten animal will be blocking the road for a long time\", said another. \"Look at his skin\", said a third, \"there is not a single piece of skin that could be used to cut sandals. \"And their ears\", exclaimed a fourth, \"are disgusting and full of blood. - He must have been hanged for robbery - another added. When Jesus heard this, he looked at the filthy beast and said, \"His teeth are whiter and more beautiful than pearls\". - he said. The crowd turned around and asked, \"Who is this?\" Is it Jesus of Nazareth? Only He could find something to condone and even something to praise in a dead dog...! And they were all ashamed, and went their way, and worshiped the Son of God. FIN", "title": "El perro muerto", "author": "Le\u00f3n Tolstoi"}
