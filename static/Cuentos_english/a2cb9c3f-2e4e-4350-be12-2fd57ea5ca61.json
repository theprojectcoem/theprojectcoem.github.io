As the first cook does not arrive, the egg is made and no one knows to whom it will be served; it is then entrusted to the messenger to bring it to the thief who requested it, before the case is solved; but the thief does not appear and the egg, while it is being boiled and roasted, turns cold and rotten. After a lot of questions to all the guests of the hotel, he gives the one who ordered the fried egg. The customer looks at it, savors it, compares it with his memories and says that he has never eaten a more delicious, more perfectly made fried egg. As the head of the taxation of the kitchen procedures comes to know everything that had happened and knows the orders, he decides: change the name of the hotel (because the client had withdrawn making great propaganda) calling it Hotel of the 3 Cookers and 1 Fried Egg, and he establishes in the kitchen rules that all fried eggs must be in a third part worked by a different cook.
