What if I go home and get something that's more favourable? I live nearby. They didn't answer. And I haven't turned around yet when I see they're no longer by my side. They were just interviewing a girl. And I was going to get into how I'm going to let a girl take a speech on my TV, but I forgot what the question was, so I went home.
