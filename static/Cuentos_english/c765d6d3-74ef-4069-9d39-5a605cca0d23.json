Already in Puerto Rico, from San Juan he went to the village of San Germ\u00e1n and by night they took him by boat along the southern coast, in Parguera. The breeze looked at the errant sargos. Night-watchmen swarmed the walls with phosphorescent light. The engines sputtered and the antenna fell. Silence. Quiet. No more burning. The sea, black black, black. He drank the water, he heard what they said (and he figured out that, in the dark, that mouth had to be smiling). Not only did it move his hands, but a caligraphy of lights spread out on the page of algae. It energised the whole hand: when she took it it re-energised like a rusty brass candlestick. Now with the two palms he cried up to heaven: and a vacant halo sought its saint. That he fill that cup, he heard the same cheerful voice say. Ezequiel knew it was true: the other had not stayed in Buenos Aires, but was still accompanying him. Although he had always felt his presence on his shoulders or in the bottom of his eyes, he had never been able to see him. He took the bucket, shook it, and, turning quickly, drained the water. The water, all reverberating with noctilucas, shook in the air and swam in an invisible form. For a moment he saw the other, clothed in a living, fluid, and reddish skin. He stood on the roof, like the ghost of a statue. His face was identical to his own, only enhanced by a bright smile.
