She lives in the house next door, I've often seen her disappear crouching through the door. A great lady in a long, wavy dress, touched with a wide feathered hat. He came in a hurry, whispering through the door, like a doctor who fears he's too late to visit a dying patient. - Anton, what are you doing? \"I'm here, I'm here!\" he shouted in a deep, though boastful voice. He dropped himself on the chair I pointed at him. \"You live very high, very high\", he said sighing. Sinking in my chair, I nodded. Countless, one after another, jumped before my eyes the steps of the stairs leading to my room, little untiring waves. - Why is it so cold? - he asked, and he took off the old long fencing gloves, then threw them on the table and looked at me with his head tilted, blinking. It felt like I was a sparrow exercising my jumps on the stairs and she was breaking down my soft gray plumage. - I'm sorry you miss me so much. I have seen your face often, consumed with sorrow, when you were in the courtyard looking out my window. Well, I don't mind you and you don't have my heart yet, so you can win it. The Commission has decided to extend the period of validity of the agreement.", "title": "Ayer vino una debilidad", "author": "Franz Kafka"}
