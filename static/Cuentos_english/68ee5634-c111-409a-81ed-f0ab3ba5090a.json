He was traveling to spread the Word of God, and one day, as he passed by a village in India, he saw a woman holding a baby in one hand and giving a sardine to a dog with the other. With his clairvoyant and timeless vision he could see who they were all in a past existence. It was a woman married to a cruel husband who beat her often. She fell in love with another man, but her father and her husband agreed to kill her. Now the woman was holding a baby in her arms, her former lover, who was to be killed. The sardine was her ruthless husband, and the dog, her father. They had all been reunited in this life, but under very different conditions.
