But the second assault was better and the Brazilian got the better of it all and the Ringo reacted and put a left-handed man in the throat that's good good good; then he followed the third one pretty good, the black one was bringing them and fit the left in the cross and the right half half half half, but Bonavena shut him up with the jaw hook and there he couldn't see what was good. In the fourth, Ringo's other right hand and the Brazilian looked for the blinch; in the fifth, he had nothing to say anymore: Pires quedo chomosca and the corner and meta bell. And Gomez told the Tons that he wasn't following the fight and the doctor went up and they moved a stick in the corner and at the end they said it was a Bonaventure nightmare in the sestorrun. All right, I didn't see any desire that he wasn't well. But I came out of the Lunapar with something in my throat and I went to sit on a bench in the Plaza de Roma. Then I realized that it was a pity, I felt sorry for the poor black Brazilian, he was more jealous than his mother. No, I'm not good for this.
