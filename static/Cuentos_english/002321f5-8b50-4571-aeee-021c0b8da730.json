He accused all mirrors of falsehood, and lived content with his false illusion. Luck, to disappoint him, presented to his eyes everywhere those dumb advisors that ladies use: mirrors in the rooms, mirrors in the shops, mirrors in the bags and even on the ladies' belts. What is our Narcissus doing? He hides in the most hidden places, not daring to undergo the test of seeing his image in the glass. But a channel that fills the water of a spring runs at his feet in that remote place: he sees it, exalts himself and thinks he sees a chimeric image. He tried his best to keep his eyes from looking at it, but the stream was so beautiful that he felt sorry to leave. You'll see where I'm going: I'm talking to everyone: that illusion that I'm talking is a mistake that we feed complacently. Our soul is the lover of itself: the mirrors, which it finds everywhere, are the foolishness of others that portray its own; and as for the channel, anyone will guess: it is the Book of Maxims. The following information is provided: The Book of Maxims: famous and classic work of the Duke of Rochefoucauld, friend of La Fontaine.", "title": "El hombre y su imagen", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
