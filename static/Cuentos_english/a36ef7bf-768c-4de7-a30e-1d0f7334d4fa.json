At morning, you go out to play and run, tumbling and falling at every turn. But who painted your dress, my son? What makes you laugh, the cape of my life? Your mother will smile upon you, standing on the umbral. When she beats her palms and resounds her bras, you dance like a shepherd, the bamboo cane in your hand. But what makes you laugh, the cape of my life? Oh, little tyrant! What do you ask your mother, hanging from her neck with both hands? Oh, insaciable heart! Do you want to take the earth from space, like a fruit, to put it in the palm of your brief hand? Oh, little tyrant! What do you want? The breeze cheerfully carries the tinkling of the bells that adorn your towers. The sun is happy to see you. Heaven is attentive to your dream when you sleep in the arms of your mother, and in the morning he comes to your bed to kiss your eyes. The bells ring around your funny toes and your joy spreads with the breeze. The hawk of dreams flies over the cranium flying toward you. The universal mother has her throne beside you, in the same heart of your mother. He has come down to you whose music you can only hear the stars, and he is playing his flute before your window. And the hawk of dreams flies over the cranium flying toward you. FIN", "title": "El cortejo invisible", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
