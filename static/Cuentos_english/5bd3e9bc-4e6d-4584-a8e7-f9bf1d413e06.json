They had always shared the peace of the forest, but it turns out that one day the crown king and the owl king met and began to exchange impressions. The crows king asked, \"Why do you and your owl legion work at night?\" The owl, amazed, replied, \"You are the ones who work at night. We work during the day. So don't lie to me. And the two kings arose in a dispute, both of them convinced that they were working by day. So much so that the discussion began to take on a violent character, that the legion of crows and owls were preparing to enter the battle. But when the situation was coming to its most critical moment, a calm swan appeared there, hearing the quarrel, said: \"All quiet, my dear companions\". And he said to the kings, Let there be no strife at all; for the two are right. From their perspective, they both work during the day. FIN", "title": "La disputa", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
