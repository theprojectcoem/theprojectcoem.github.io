His wife died, and he remarried another who was very bad, and he hated his poor little understanders. These, who were very afraid of their stepmother, were always together, remembering and weeping for their mother. One day the stepmother told the girl to go to the store for a silk dress, and the boy to go for a spice room, and she would give a jam to the first one who came back. The first one who came back was the kid. The stepmother took him, put him on the table, killed him and cut him to pieces, which she put in a barley and stored in the pot. And the girl came back, and her mother-in-law came out, and sought her little brother; and she sought him, but she found him not, until she opened the cup, and found him cut to pieces. Then he began to weep bitterly and said, \"Woe to me, my dear brother! That I have been killed and cut to pieces, lest I bury him in the ground where he may rest! And taking one of the little bones, he went to the barn and buried it. She saw a carrot born, and she saw her little brother come out of it, only he was much more beautiful than before, and he had glitters. - Oh, my little brother! - said- - Didn't your stepmother kill you? \"Yes\", said the boy, \"but I have risen and come for you. - And why? - To reward you for burying me and crying. - So where are we going? - the girl asked. And his little brother answered and said, For a very light path, a very bright path, a very bright path, a very bright path. - And the stepmother, where's she going? - he asked the girl again. And the boy said, The way is very dark, very dark, very dark, to hell. Popular tales, fortunes and refrains, 1921", "title": "Los dos caminitos", "author": "Fern\u00e1n Caballero"}
