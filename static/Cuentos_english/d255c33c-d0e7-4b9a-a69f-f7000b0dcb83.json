They make enough noise that the sacristan hears them from the rectory, and decides to go and see what's going on. It is night; the sacristan divides between the tombs two silhouettes that seem horrifying to him. They seem to be telling and the man hears them say, \"One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me... terrified, the sacristan runs away, goes to find the priest and trembles as he tells him the thing in his own way: I assure you, the souls of the dead were being divided. The priest raises his arms to heaven, but the other one insists so much that he ends up following him. They both gently approach the sad place where humans are buried, but they dare not enter and are content to pay attention.

Believing they were talking about them, the priest and the sacristan flee in fear. They're still running.
