But he also lived in Paris, his name was Jean and his father worked in an automobile factory. But he also lived in Berlin, and up there his name was Kart and his father was a cello teacher. But he also lived in Moscow, his name was Yuri, like Gagarin, and his father was a mason and studied mathematics. But he also lived in New York, his name was Jimmy, and his father owned a gas station. How many have I said? - Five of them. I am missing two: one was named Ci\u00fa, who lived in Shanghai and his father was a fisherman; the last was named Pablo, who lived in Buenos Aires, and his father was a climber. Paolo, Jean, Kart, Yuri, Jimmy, Ciu and Paul were seven, but always the same eight-year-old boy, who could read and write and rode his bicycle without holding his hands on the handlebar. Paolo was a trigo, Jean was white and Kart was a brown, but they were the same kid. Yuri had white skin, Ciu had yellow, but they were the same kid. Pablo went to the movies in Spanish and Jimmy in English, but they were the same kid, and they laughed in the same language. Now the seven have grown up, and they cannot make war, for the seven are one person. FIN", "title": "Uno y siete", "author": "Gianni Rodari"}
