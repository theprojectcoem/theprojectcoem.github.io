Putting it upside down, he recognized the judge, a man famous for delivering harsh sentences for moral wrongdoing. Nasrudin took off his elegant buffalo and cloak and went on his way. The next day, when the judge came home with his feet back on, he realized he had been robbed. Livido, he told the police they'll search every house until they find the culprit. It wasn't long before Nasrudin was brought to court. Where did you get those bunnies and that cloak? The judge asked. I took them from a drunk I found lying on the couch last night, the mule replied.
