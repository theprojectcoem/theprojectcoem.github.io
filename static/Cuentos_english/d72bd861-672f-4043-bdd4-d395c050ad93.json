Seeing a dove in this emergency, he pulled a branch from a tree, threw it into the stream, climbed the ant and saved it. Meanwhile a bird hunter advanced with his gun ready to hunt the dove. The ant saw him and bit him in the heel, causing the hunter to drop his gun. The pigeon took advantage of the moment to lift the flight. We must be grateful and return the favors we have received.", "title": "La paloma y la hormiga", "author": "nan Esopo"}
