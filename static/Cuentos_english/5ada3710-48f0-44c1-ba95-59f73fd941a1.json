The few who survived, not daring to leave their hiding place, went through a thousand hardships. And for those unfortunate, Micifuf was no longer a cat, but the devil himself. One night when the enemy had the weakness to go in search of a cat, with whom he entertained himself in long conversation, the surviving rats held a council in a corner, to deal with the affairs of the day. The Dean Rat, who was a pro rat, said that the sooner Micifuf was thrown a rope around his neck, the sooner he went hunting, the better they could hear him coming and getting into the pit. He couldn't think of any other way. Everyone thought it was great. There was only one difficulty: putting the cat's head in the water. One said, \"I don't wear what I am; I'm not that stupid. I didn't dare to answer the other one either. And without doing anything, the assembly was dissolved. How many meetings and meetings does the same thing happen! Do we have to deliberate and argue? Counselors are popping up everywhere. Is there anything we need to do? They don't count on anyone anymore. FIN", "title": "Gran consejo celebrado por las Ratas", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
