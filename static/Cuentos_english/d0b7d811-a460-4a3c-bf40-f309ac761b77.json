One night the rooster climbed a tree and the dog lay at the foot of the log. And as was his custom, he sang the rooster before dawn. He heard a fox singing and ran to the site, standing at the foot of the tree. She begged him to come down, for she wanted to kiss an animal with such an exquisite voice.
