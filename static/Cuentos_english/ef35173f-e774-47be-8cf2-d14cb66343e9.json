The young hermit had become very famous and enjoyed a great reputation, while the old man was a stranger. One day, the old man took a boat and traveled to the islet of the famous hermit. He paid him honors and asked for spiritual instruction. The young man gave him a mantra and provided him with the necessary instructions for repeating it. Grateful, the elder took the boat back to his island, while his fellow seeker was very proud of having been spiritually reclaimed. The old man was very happy with the mantra. He was a simple man with a pure heart. All his life he had done nothing but be a man of good feelings and now, in his old age, he wanted to do some methodical practice. The young hermit was reading the scriptures, when, a few hours after leaving, the old man returned. He was very sad, and he said, \"Venerable ascetic, it turns out I've forgotten the exact words of the mantra. I'm sorry to be a poor ignorant. Can you point me in again? The young man looked at the old man with condescension and repeated the mantra. Full of pride, he said to himself:  Little can this poor man advance on the path to Reality if he is not even able to retain a mantra. But his surprise was extraordinary when he suddenly saw the old man walking toward his island. See the story The Three Hermits", "title": "Pureza de coraz\u00f3n", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
