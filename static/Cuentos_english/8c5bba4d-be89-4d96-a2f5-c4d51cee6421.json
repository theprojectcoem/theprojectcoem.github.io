I look at him with the discomfort of having his head misplaced and with the discomfort of the soul that is misunderstood. He will die and I will die. He will leave the altar and I will leave the verses. The liar will also die one day, and the verses will also die. After that day, the street where the lintel stood and the language in which the verses were written will be destroyed. It will die after the spinning planet where all this happened. In other satellites of other systems something like people will continue to do things like verse and live under things like rafters. FIN", "title": "Estanco", "author": "Fernando Pessoa"}
