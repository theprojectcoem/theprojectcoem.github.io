Do not pick up any objects thrown on the street or in any other public place. In such cases, there is always the risk of delegates appearing, who at the same time act as witnesses and executors to drag the suspect to the door of any accusation. It is always irrevocably proven after five minutes of searching that the object collected was the key piece of a crime related to a certain case still open and that the fingerprints are, of course, irrefutable evidence. The object found becomes, on the spot, criminal evidence; the suspect, in turn, becomes guilty; the situation, desperate. The phenomenon is most arbitrary because, in fact, there are never any police cases in the city. No one's ever killed, no one's ever stolen. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that a flagrant offence is thus proved. FIN", "title": "Las pruebas", "author": "Jacques Sternberg"}
