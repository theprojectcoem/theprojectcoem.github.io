But at the bottom of the river lived a huge crocodile, who was also hungry and, hidden between the mud and the reeds, spied on the jackal waiting for him to take a wrong step and fall into the water to eat it. On several occasions the jackal was about to get into the crocodile's mouth, but using his cunning hand, he managed to escape the mortal danger. Then, fearing to be swallowed by the fierce crocodile, the jackal decided to go fishing elsewhere in the river, where it was not under constant threat from the saurian. But this one, starving and mad with rage at seeing that such a rich bite was escaping him, determined to get out of the river and go in search of the jackal's lair to avenge himself on him. And that was their doom, because upon hearing the cunning jackal that the crocodile was waiting inside his pit to eat it, he lit a huge bonfire at the entrance until the enemy, powerless to break through the flame barrier, was reduced to a pile of ashes. The element itself gives strength and confidence; to leave it is a reckless risk. FIN * Panchatantra, second century BCE", "title": "El chacal y el cocodrilo", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
