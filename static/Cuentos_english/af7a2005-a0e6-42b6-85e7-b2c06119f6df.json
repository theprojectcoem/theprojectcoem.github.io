It was dark in her hair, and dawn smiling on her lips. Though the beautiful stranger appeared before his eyes, the young men stood up and surrounded her. One wanted to dance with her, and the other day cut a cake in her honor. And everyone wanted to kiss her cheek. After all, wasn't this a fairy fair? But the girl was surprised and upset, and thought badly of the young men. He rebuked them and then hit one or two of them in the face. Then he ran away. On the way home that afternoon, she said in her heart, \"I'm upset. How rude and ill-mannered these men are! They are beyond all patience. And it was a year, during which the beautiful girl thought a lot about fairs and men. Then he returned to the fair with the lily and the rose on his face, the sunset on his hair and the smile of dawn on his lips. But now the young men, seeing her, turned their backs on her. And she stayed all day ignored and alone. And when evening came, as he went to his house, he wept in his heart, saying, I am grieved. How rude and ill-mannered these men are! They are beyond all patience. FIN", "title": "En la Feria", "author": "Gibr\u00e1n Jalil Gibr\u00e1n"}
