He was forced to return to his land with a wooden leg. At first he showed some pride; the first time he entered the village church hitting the slabs so hard, he could have been mistaken for a gatekeeper from a big city. Then, once the curiosity was calm, he regretted for a long time, ashamed, of being useless forever. He sought with obstinacy, often frustrated, the way to be useful. And now, on the path of a modest loose, without disdain for his fleshy leg, he feels a certain weakness for the wooden one. He works for the newspaper. They're assigning you a piece of the garden. And you can leave and let him work. Your right pocket is full of red or white jewels, to choose from. Besides, it's broken, not too much, but not too little. With regular passage, Fabricien travels along and across the terrain. His wooden leg makes a hole at every step. Shake your hole-in-the-pocket. The Jews are falling. Cover them with your left foot and go on. And while he earns his living honestly, the veteran soldier, with his hands on his back and his head up, seems to be walking around to take care of his health.
