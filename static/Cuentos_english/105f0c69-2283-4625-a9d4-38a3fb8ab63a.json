The minister was very interested in spiritual evolution and regularly practiced the mantra. They were talking about it. - Can I choose my own mantra and have the same power as the one your mentor gave you? - asked the monarch. - No, said the minister. The mantra provided by the guru is more powerful. \"I do not see any reason at all for it\", said the king. Then the centurion returned to the captain of the guard and said, \"Arrest the king\". The commander of the guard ignored the command, but the ruler was indignant with the accusation. \"Arrest this man and put him in prison, \" he ordered. The chief of the guard sent his men to arrest the minister. He was about to be taken to prison, when he said, \"Lord, do you realize that?\" It depends on who's giving the order.
