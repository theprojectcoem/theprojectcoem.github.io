One evening, as the sparks broke the silence of the afternoon, he went to a yogis' modest house and knocked on the door. - Who is it? - asked the yogi. - It's me, my respected teacher. I've come to you for spiritual instruction. \"You're not mature enough\", replied the yogi without opening the door. Retreat to a cave for a year and meditate. Meditate without rest. Then come back and I'll give you instructions. At first the disciple was discouraged, but he was a true seeker, one who does not give up in his endeavor and tracks down the truth even at the risk of his life. So he obeyed the yogi. He searched for a cave in the mountain slope and for a year he immersed himself in deep meditation. He learned to be with himself; he practiced in the Being. The monsoon rains have overtaken. By these the disciple knew that a year had passed since he had arrived in the cave. He abandoned it and set off for the master's house. He knocked on the door. - Who is it? - asked the yogi. \"It's you\", replied the disciple. - If so, - said the yogi, - come in. There was no room in this house for two selves.
