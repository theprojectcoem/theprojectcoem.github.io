That's why he was always laughing at the slow turtle. - Look at the turtle! Hey, turtle, don't run so fast you'll get tired of going so fast! - said the hare laughing at the turtle. One day, while they were talking, the turtle suddenly thought of making a rare bet on the hare. \"I'm sure I can win you a race\", she told him. - What about me? - she asked, amazed, the hare. - Well, yes, you are. Let's put our bet on that stone and see who wins the race. The hare, very funny, agreed. All the animals gathered to witness the race. He signaled the way and the destination. Once he was ready, he started the race amidst applause. Confident in her lightness, the hare let the turtle go and became a whirlwind. I wish you had more time to win over such a dumb creature! Then he started running, running as fast as the wind as the turtle went slowly, but, that's right, unstoppable. And the hare came forward, and stood by the side of the road, and sat down to rest. When the turtle passed by her side, the hare took the opportunity to mock her once more. He gave him the advantage and again set out on his fast march. Several times she repeated the same thing, but despite her laughter, the turtle kept walking unstoppably. Confident in her speed, the hare fell under a tree and fell asleep. Meanwhile, I passed by, and as light as I could, the turtle continued its way to the finish line. When the hare woke up, she ran with all her might but it was too late, the turtle had won the race. That day was very sad for the hare and it learned a lesson that I will never forget: Never make fun of others. We must also learn from this that laziness and overconfidence can make us fail to reach our goals.", "title": "La liebre y la tortuga", "author": "nan Esopo"}
