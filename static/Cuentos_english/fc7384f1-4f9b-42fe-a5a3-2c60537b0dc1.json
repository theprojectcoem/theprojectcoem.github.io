One day, at two o'clock, they were suddenly invited to visit the king and began to talk about how pleasant it would be to visit him. Other nearby limas surprised the conversation and were astonished by the same desire. They were joined by others and eventually all the limas began to discuss the matter and gradually the vain desire became a force. Why not go today, some said, but others thought it would be better to wait until the next day. Meanwhile, without their knowledge, they had come near to the angel, who was very calm, as if he were unaware of anything. They continued to discuss, always coming closer to the iman, and the more they talked, the stronger the impulse, until the most eager declared that they were going that day, did what the others had done. He heard some saying that their duty was to visit the ark and that it was long past time for them to do so. While they were talking, they were unconsciously approaching each other. Finally the impasse prevailed, and in an irresistible clamour the whole community cried: -It is useless to wait. We are going today. Let's go now. We are in the act. The unyielding mass sprang up and was pinned to the ground on all sides. The lion roared, for the steel lions were convinced that his visit was voluntary.
