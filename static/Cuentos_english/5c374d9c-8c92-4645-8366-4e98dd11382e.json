The journey was long, and as night began to fall, a violent storm broke out. It was raining so torrentially that we had to shelter ourselves. They split up a house far away and started running towards it. They knocked on the door and a woman who owned the house and was a farmer and a flower seller opened the door. Seeing the fishermen completely soaked, he offered them a room to spend the night quietly. It was a large room where there were a large number of baskets with beautiful and very varied flowers, ready to be sold the next day. The fishermen were exhausted and went to sleep. However, they could not sleep and began to complain about the smell of the flowers: \"What a plague! No one can handle this smell. So there's no one to sleep. Then one of them had an idea and suggested it to her colleagues: \"No one can stand this plague, friends, and, unless we put a cure, we won't be able to catch an eye. Grab the fish baskets and use them as a pillow and we'll get around this nasty smell. The women followed their partner's suggestion. They took the fish baskets and put their heads on them. It had barely been a minute and they were all asleep. FIN", "title": "Las pescadoras", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
