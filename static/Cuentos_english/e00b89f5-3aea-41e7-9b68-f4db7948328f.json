When night came, he took them all to his cave. The next morning a violent storm broke out. He could not carry them to the grass, so he kept them in the house. But while he gave his own goats only a handful of fodder, the mounted ones needed much more, for the purpose of keeping them. The bad weather ended and they all went out into the field, but the wild goats escaped to the mountains. And the shepherd reproached them with ungrateful words, for having left him after he had so well tended them; but they said, More reason to distrust thee; for if thou hast treated us, who are new, better than thy old and loyal servants, then if there come other goats, then wilt thou despise us for them. Don't trust those who offer you friendship while they abandon their friends.", "title": "Las cabras monteses y el cabrero", "author": "nan Esopo"}
