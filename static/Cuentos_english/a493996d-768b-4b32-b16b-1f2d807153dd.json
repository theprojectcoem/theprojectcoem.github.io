As his death drew near and the abbot did not return, he confessed his sins to the prior. That same night, the abbot was sleeping in an inn. Before his bed, the spirit of the deceased appeared to him, imploring him to hear his confession. \"I'd love to hear you\", the abbot replied. Then the young man confessed all his sins. His repentance was so great that even his tears seemed to fall on the abbot's chest. After confession, he said, \"I leave with your blessing, father. Only now can I save myself. With these words, the abbot woke up and wanted to check whether the apparition had been real or a delusion of the imagination. He felt the habit in his chest, finding it completely wet. And he told the master of the monastery his dream, and he said, The vision is real; for he confessed to me as he commanded thee.
