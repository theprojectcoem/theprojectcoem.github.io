If the sun gave them they melted, so they had to be always in the shade, and they lived in a city where instead of houses there were refrigerators. Juanito was walking down the street and he could see them staring at the windows of his refrigerators, with a bag of ice on their heads. On the door of every refrigerator there was a phone to talk to the tenant. - Hey, you know what? - Say it. - Who am I talking to? - I'm the king of butter men. All of them are top quality. Swiss cow's milk. Did you get it right in my fridge? - Oh, my God, it's solid gold! But he never leaves? - In winter, when it's quite cold, and in an ice car. - What if the sun comes up suddenly while Your Majesty is walking? - You can't do that. It's not allowed. I'd have you imprisoned for my soldiers. - \"Buf!\" said Juanito. And he went to another country. FIN", "title": "Los hombres de mantequilla", "author": "Gianni Rodari"}
