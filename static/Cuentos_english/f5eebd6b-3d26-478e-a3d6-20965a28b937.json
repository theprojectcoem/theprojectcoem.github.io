He tried to regain his dream of happiness and failed. Now she did cry, but with her face hurt against her pillow, so lonely and unlucky on the dark night. But Helena knew, pretended she didn't hear and came from the other bedroom. Patience, you were listening to the tragedy. That they stole half my happy dream with a beach and a sea with their chalk horses. The other girl, Judith, joined the discourse. I had a good, weird dream but when they woke me up he was gone, I lost him, I don't remember anything. So in the morning Helena dressed the girls and they went to the market. The entrance was wide but as soon as we walked we stumbled upon thick marble columns with bright colors like in the Cordoba mosque and which forced, as we advanced, to parade and man ourselves and try crooked paths until we reached the large tile courtyard with an incessant water fountain. Slow winged and half-horned marmots were hovering by the roof. One of them went down and, without looking at Helena, gently bit the girls' heads and led them through a new forest of columns to a small altar where a seraphim received them smiling and didn't need questions to know what they wanted. Helena still at the door, who knows, forgotten, and impeded by columns that rose, huge and thick, jasper cylinders, rising at every step, ordering to force her to follow a vibrating path, which turned into an imperious maze and led out, leading her without violence to the leafless door, to the sidewalk where she was already waiting for the girls with the well-known poppy petals that guarantee sleep and her untouchable absurdity.
