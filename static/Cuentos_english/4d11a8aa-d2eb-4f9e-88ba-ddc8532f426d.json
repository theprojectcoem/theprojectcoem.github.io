Please go get some water in the wells that you can see across the rice paddy. I'll wait for you in the shade of these trees. The young man crossed the field and in the well he met a girl who was drawing water. He was attracted to her and gently asked her name. She answered him with a smile. A little later he proposed that he take the vessel to the village. She agreed. Already in the village he was invited to eat at the young woman's house. He met the whole family and ended up asking the girl for her hand. They gave it to you. After the wedding he worked as a farmer, had children and educated them. One died of illness. His in-laws also died and he became the head of the family. His eldest son got married and left. His wife, with her hair already done, died shortly after. He cried because he loved her so much. Days later a flood devastated the valley. He was dragged along like his neighbors by a muddy water whirlwind. He struggled to hold his youngest son, who was drowning before his eyes. Suddenly, not knowing why, he remembered his friend, the old man who had asked him for water. Immediately he found himself on dry land, crossing a field, with a jar in his hand. He went back to the old man, who was asleep under a tree. Something in the air, which had become pure and light, seemed to indicate to the young man that he was on the very threshold of the great mystery of Vishnu, the god who holds the worlds in place. And the old man awoke, and said to him, The sun is already setting. You took a long time. I was just about to go get you. FIN", "title": "La rueda del tiempo", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
