I'm an orphan now, so I have to work every two to three. I must clarify that I have completed schooling 16 years of primary school, two per year and also military service. I mean, you wouldn't have to take care of my instruction and it would be very useful to you, because I could take care of your other children, my dear brothers and sisters. I'm healthy, except for the first and 15 days of every month and Sunday morning when my head hurts. And I'm missing a tooth because of a fling with a partner, but I'm generally strong, especially on my legs. I have a cheerful character. I like to sing and I know a lot of jokes, like the widow and the squirrel or the squirrel. I'll be happy to tell you about them, but only if you feel like it. I'm an obedient boy. I can be left at home with the maid or even alone, I don't need help shaving and my stomach never hurts. As far as sex education goes, you'll save yourself the bad drink, because I'm already in. When the time comes, I could add some detail on the subject if I came to the story. I'm practical and I can do good service at home: fix a faucet, get the crown glowing, discharge coal for the winter; I can do everything, and you wouldn't have to call people from outside. Cheap and reliable. I'm good with English. When they're doing an English movie in the cinema, I read the subtitles out loud and I understand everything, especially if it's about Indians and cowboys. Without further ado, I remain at His Majesty's disposal for any clarification. I'm always by the beer kiosk, but if for some reason you don't find me there, leave the message to my friend who works in the corner. Memories for Dad. A respectful greeting, the Principle End", "title": "El hijito", "author": "Slawomir Mrozek"}
