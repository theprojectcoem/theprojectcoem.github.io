He himself had forgotten her, among other reasons, because he had transcended all human attachment and ambition. I was sitting one day under a huge banyan tree, my eyes lost on the horizon, my mind still like a cloudless sky. Suddenly, he saw a young man throwing a rope over a branch of a tree and tying one of its ends to its neck. The wise man realized the young man's intentions, ran to him and asked him to give up his purpose even if it was only a few minutes to listen. The young man agreed, and they both sat down by the tree. The old man said, \"I'm going to make a plea to you, dear friend. Imagine a single turtle in the vast ocean and only pulling its head out to the surface once every million years. Imagine a ring floating above the waters of the vast ocean. For even more difficult than the turtle's head getting into the water ring is to have gotten human form. Now, my friend, proceed as you see fit. Local people still tell us that this young man became old and became wise. FIN", "title": "La tortuga y la argolla", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
