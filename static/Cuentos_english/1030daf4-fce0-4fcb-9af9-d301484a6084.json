At first the shepherd watched him and cared for him like an enemy. But as the wolf followed him and never attempted any robbery, the shepherd came to think that he had rather an ally guardian. One day, the shepherd, having to go to the village, left his sheep safely by the wolf and left. The wolf, seeing the time had come, rushed over the flock and devoured almost everything.
