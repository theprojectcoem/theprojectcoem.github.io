And when we tell them that three of us could do nothing else because Monch\u00edn was a hallelujah, Lucy says: You know what it's like. And then the preliminaries: the beers, the Chesterfields, the handshake under the table. And half-high-minded Monchin (he was even bothered by the chuchaks on those records), but without saying anything. Old man, what's your deal? Tell him Horti and put his hand here. At once Monchin wanted to leave, but I held him back, telling him we'd accompany him to the corner. So, as he walked in front of us while we were grabbing shell-shelled buttocks and kissing colorette, I arranged with Sara and the boys. You know what it's like. Before we got to the corner, we put him in the alley and gave Sara the cataplane. Sara turned into an octopus on top of him... I don't know. And Monchin threw up. No drinking, you know. And how he cried! You know how it is. I don't know. FIN Spiks, 1956", "title": "Miniatura II", "author": "Pedro Juan Soto"}
