Those are friends; not our country. One night, while they were both resting, taking advantage of the absence of the sun, one of them rose from his bed all red, ran to his companion's house, called the servants: Morpheus reigned in that mansion. The sleeping friend wakes up shocked, takes the bag, takes the guns, and goes out looking for the other. - What's the matter? - he asks. You're not used to going around the world at this time; you better use the time you've been assigned to sleep. Have you lost your flow to the game? Here's the gold. Do you have any pitches left? I've got the sword. Come on. Tired of sleeping alone? I have a very beautiful slave by my side. I'll call her if you want. \"No\", replied the friend, \"it's not that. I was dreaming of seeing you, and I thought you were a little sad. I was afraid it was true and I came running. That bad dream is to blame. Which of these two friends was the friend of the other? There is a question worth clarifying. Oh, what a great thing a good friend is! Investigate your needs and spare yourself the shame of revealing them: a dream, a harbinger, an illusion: everything scares you, if it's the loved one.
