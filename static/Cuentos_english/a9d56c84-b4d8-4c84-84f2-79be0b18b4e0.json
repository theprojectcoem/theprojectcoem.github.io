At a glance, the eagle, who was powerful, lowered its head and passed without eating: it felt like a jailed queen. Another man came by, saw it, liked it, and decided to buy it. He pulled out his cut feathers and made them grow back. The eagle took off its wings, took flight and grabbed a hare to take it as a thank you to its deliverer. And the fox saw her, and evil counselled her, saying, Bring not the hare unto him that delivered thee, but unto him that took thee captive; for he that delivered thee is a good man, and no more stimuli. Try to soften the other one instead, don't go back to catching you and rip your wings off completely. Give thy soul ever to the good-doers; and with understanding keep away from the wicked.", "title": "El \u00e1guila de ala cortada y la zorra", "author": "nan Esopo"}
