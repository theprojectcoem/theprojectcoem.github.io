Nor could it be proven that the Battle of Blenheim was fought, that Julius Caesar existed, that there was an Assyrian empire. Instead, and since the court records are admissible evidence, it can easily be proven that powerful and perverse magicians have existed that were a scourge to mankind. The evidence (including confessions) that served to condemn and execute certain women by witches, had no flaws; it is still unassailable today. The judicial decisions based on it were just within logic and law. Nothing is better proved in a court of law than the witchcraft charges that led to so many deaths. If witches didn't exist, human testimony and human reason would be equally worthless. FIN", "title": "Inadmisible", "author": "Ambrose Bierce"}
