Over time, these Unmeasured Maps were not satisfactory and the Colleges of Cartographers raised a Map of the Empire, which was the size of the Empire and coincided precisely with it. Less devoted to cartography, the following generations understood that that dilated map was useless and not without its limitations, and gave it to the emperors of the sun and the winter.
