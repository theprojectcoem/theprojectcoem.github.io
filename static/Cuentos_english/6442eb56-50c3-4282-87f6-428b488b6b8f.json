However, he did not die, and as he got out of bed he found that his children no longer wanted him, nor had they with him the delicacies of before, when everyone was hoping to get the most out of their fortune. Everyone treated him badly, and they did not say that they wished him to die as soon as possible, since his life was only a source of expense and inconvenience. The poor man kept on crying, and one day he met an old friend, to whom he told what was happening to him. The friend, moved by what he had just heard, promised to find a solution to that state of affairs. For he found her and within a few days came in great pomp to his friend's house, followed by ten servants who were carrying heavy sacks full of stones. And it came to pass when they were alone, that the friend said, I have brought these stones to thee, that I may deceive thy sons. When I'm gone, they'll come to see what I brought you. Tell them I've come to pay you a very old debt, and you're richer than before. You'll see how everyone's living off you. I'll be back in a while to see how things are going. After a few months, the friend returned and found the old man surrounded by his children, who were all eager to see him. And they kept doing it until he died, then discovering the deception, that they deserved it.", "title": "C\u00f3mo fueron enga\u00f1ados los malos hijos", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
