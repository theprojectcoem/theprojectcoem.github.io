On the great Nordic bed a woman and a man are igniting in the tasks of love, united by their mouths and by the center of their bodies, holding hands in the shipwreck that drags them to the bottom of happiness. In the unique moment, as she mutters the words that only they know, he suddenly steps back and looks her eyes closed. In the face of the woman, who is bleached by the snow and the love contacts agony, the man sees the faces of all those left in the remote country: the final moan of the tortured, the red-eyed eyes of the hopeless wives, the sweat of those who are about to disappear, the trembling in the throats of the girls who are being raped. The night that surrounds them contains all the scenery and silences of the memory intact, useless. Open your eyes, man, I pray silently, or I will die of this pain.", "title": "Exilio", "author": "Carlos Mar\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez"}
