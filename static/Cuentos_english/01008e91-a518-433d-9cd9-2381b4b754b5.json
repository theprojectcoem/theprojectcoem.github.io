The nobles of the court were very concerned because the sovereign, possessed of loving ardor and forgotten of royal dignity, neglected the affairs of the Empire. When the girl died suddenly, the dignitaries breathed relief, but for a short time, because Charlemagne's love had not died with her. The Emperor, who had the embalmed corpse taken to his room, did not want to part with him. Archbishop Turpin, frightened by this macabre passion, suspected a spell and wanted to examine the corpse. Hidden under the dead tongue, he found a ring with a precious stone. Not because the ring was in Turpin's hands, Charlemagne hurried to bury the corpse and poured his love into the archbishop's person. To escape the embarrassing situation, Turpin threw the ring into Lake Constanza. Charlemagne fell in love with Lake Constance and never wanted to move away from its shores again.
