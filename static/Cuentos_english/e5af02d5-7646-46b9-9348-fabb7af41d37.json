Once in a while he looked at her and she gave a tristonic smile and nothing more. It was the complicated time of the commercial closure. The car was full and had an acrid smell, a mix of soot and sewage. Same as in 65. It was a relief to finally arrive at Vaugirard station. He took the bag with which she had appeared two hours earlier at the Lyon train station. Now it was snowing, and how. \u2014We bought baguettes, Gruy\u00e8re and Beaujolais? \u2014 Yes, of course, as always. \u2014So we don\u2019t go to dinner. \u2014 Better. The street is a mess. \u2014At least in the mansard there is heating. \u2014 That's great. They made the purchases. They added gaulois and phosphorus for him; chocolate for her. She loaded the new packages, and he the sack. They climbed the rue Cambronne, arm in arm to protect themselves from the snow, but walking slowly to not slip. In the hotel on Blomet Street, Madame Benoit greeted them with the aft and distant smile of habit. She gave him her hand and said the classic phrase: she was glad that Mrs. M\u00e9ndez [Madame Mand\u00e9s] had arrived well. She smiled and bowed in response to another banal kindness. He picked up his key and they climbed up to the room. It was a mansion with one window, in whose front the snow was gathered. Near the window there was a table and two chairs. The double bed had a blue cover. On the wall, a coloured reproduction of Renoir. The simplicity was enough and welcoming. \u2014I could not get the same room. 42 is occupied. \u2014It doesn\u2019t matter. It's beautiful, and it burns calories. However, she did not take off her coat. It was frozen. He opened the trunk and began to take out some clothes. He opened the doors of a closet almost a year ago. \u2014I have left you free on the right. She did not answer, but began to put her clothes in the sacks and baskets that he had assigned her. He went to the wash basin, opened the tap and waited for the hot water to come out. He washed his hands. Then the packages were opened and the food was placed on the table. He broke the bottle. He cut each baguette in two and distributed the cheese rebundades. She was still arranging her things in the armoire when he came behind her and put his hand on her shoulder. She tilted her head to that side to feel the contact of the hand. Then he wanted to kiss her. \u2014Now not. I have hunger. \u2014 I do too. She washed her face. Then he came to the table. They sex silently for a good while. \u2014What banquet. \u2014I must confess that this is my dinner almost every night. \u2014A wonderful thing. He was dead of hunger. In the subway as a little girl, I felt a little frightened. \u2014And now? \u2014Now not. The wine and cheese brought me back to life. \u2014You have turned the color of your eyes. You are pure. \u2014 Hunger. \u2014You used to eat with less appetite. \u2014Before here or before Uruguay? \u2014Not here nor there. You were always unprepared. \u2014You see, you've seen that. It must be a sort of destitution. The truth is that when I had to go on a 72-day fast, I went to starvation. Hunger of the truth. \u2014 I know. In the prison the food was rotten. It was never exquisite dog food, but it was food. And I drank the blood, too. \u2014Yes, you look very online. \u2014You are beautiful. \u2014Bah. \u2014I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s pretty. You have another expression. As if you were now more woman. \u2014Caramba. She began to put the cheesecakes in a paper bag. And you feel more manly? \u2014 I don\u2019t know. In some sense, I am in agreement with myself, for I stayed without talking, without blaming anyone. In those days of madness, this became an obsession. Don't talk, especially don't talk. And you look so small? Among other things, I am here because you don't speak. \u2014Nothing more than that? \u2014No. I mean, if you had spoken, and even if I had been borked, you would have had data to get to me. Or to keep me from leaving. \u2014Nothing more than that you are here? \u2014Don't be a bobo. You know I'm here because I wanted to see you. \u2014I too wanted to see. And I wanted you to want to see me. \u2014Oh, how hard. \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to say it any simpler. She screamed. \u2014 Well, here we are. \u2014In the hotel on Blomet Street. Who would say, in 1965, that we would be doing what we are doing? \u2014No one. \u2014Do you want me to tell you something? I think the milliners didn't know either. \u2014You didn\u2019t know what? \u2014For example: that they could be so inhuman. \u2014Look. But the most important thing was that we didn't know. What a slew of abstractions, don't you think? He took his hand. \u2014I think so. But now you are something very concrete and I like you. The abstractions are over. She recovered her triston smile. \u2014Laura is also something very concrete. And you like it. You know that is not a criticism. Oscar is also something equally concrete. And I like it. Aren't they objective data, right? \u2014 Yes, of course. \u2014 Laura knows who we were going to see in Paris? \u2014I did not frighten. And I swear to you that it was not because of lack of sincerity. But it is coming back very slowly. Chile was a second cataclysm for her. \u2014Who is not? And Oscar knows? \u2014Oscar yes. \u2014How did he take it? \u2014All right. That is, as well as you can take something like that. I knew I could not feel secure in my relationship with him until I was no longer seeing him. \u2014And you? \u2014It happens to me too. \u2014We are all insecure, aren\u2019t we? I too. I have a good relationship with Laura. But I also had it with you. I don't know. If you and I had broken up over some personal conflict, over some misunderstanding, it would have been different. But you and I were a beautiful couple, weren't we? \u2014We will. \u2014Come. Both were without touching the bed. Each one sat down by himself and gave the back. \u2014You are? \u2014I am. Come. They slowly turned, as if they were slaves to a symmetrical choreography. Also as if they were repeating an ancient ritual. They stood front to front, naked. He is enslaving her. Then she froze without remedy. She embraced the man, began to swell, not able to contain, not trying to contain herself. He felt how her tears soaked into his sleeve, his crotch. A fatter lump than the others slid down to its belly and sat there. He was rubbing his hair. He would sometimes pull him back to kiss his cheeks. She kept crying, she didn't know whether she was happy or sad. He lowered his hands and accentuated his pleasure. They were almost instinctively reclining on the bed. Soon he felt that the tears that were streaming down his face could also be his. I was moved and eager. Her hands began to recover that body that was her known victuals, her complement. And slowly the sloes were turning into something else. Both are still lying down. He smokes, she eats her chocolate. The man's free hand is placed on the windscreen of the car. \u2014How we got married. \u2014 Yes. \u2014They broke us. \u2014 Yes. \u2014We split into two. \u2014 Yes. \u2014You're decided? \u2014I am. \u2014I don't know, I don't know. \u2014Why? \u2014I didn\u2019t want to do Laura any harm. But I don't want to be joking myself. \u2014You're a loser. I'm sorry. We have to understand it once and for all. There are also married Oscar and Laura. They will never have us all. But if you and I were to get together, they would not be able to live, because they are much weaker than you and I. And in that situation, we would not be happy. Is it so or I don't know you well? \u2014You know me well. His hand fell down a short rail and he fell, tibia. \u2014It will be difficult, right? \u2014About everything from today. Her hand covered his hand. \u2014We split into two. - More than that - she said - they parted us in pieces. *FIN* With and without nostalgia, 1977", "title": "El hotelito de la rue Blomer", "author": "Mario Benedetti"}
