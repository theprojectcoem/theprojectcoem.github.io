But he was unsuccessful in everything he did. The money from the convent was turned into fire and his money into straw. He could not help but be surprised by the prosperity of the other traders and his own failure. As her brother gave her more money, her losses grew bigger and bigger. What are you doing, brother? \"Why do you waste your fortune so much on yourself and me?\" I live very modestly, trade with the utmost prudence. I can't understand what's happening to me. He hurried to a clergyman, who confessed everything to him. \"Because your brother's money is stolen, he's devoured yours\", the clergyman explained. Take nothing from him, and trade with the little that remains of thee, and thou shalt see the good hand of God that is upon thee. And of all that thou gavest, give half to thy brother, and live with the rest, until thou hast returned all the money that thou hadst received from the convent. The man took the advice and soon became rich, having returned the money from the convent. Where's your wealth coming from now, brother? The abbot asked him. That he abhorred our laughter.
