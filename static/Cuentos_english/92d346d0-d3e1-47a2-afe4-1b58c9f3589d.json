He moves to H for a preliminary interview, puts ten minutes on going and ten on coming back, and boast at his house of that speed. The next day he goes back to H, this time to close the deal. As that will probably take him many hours, A leaves very early. Although the circumstances (at least in A's opinion) are precisely those of the night before, it takes ten hours this time to reach H. He arrives at sunset, surrendered. They tell him that B, worried about his delay, has recently left for the village of A and that they must have crossed paths. They advise you to wait. A, however, impatient for the business, immediately leaves and returns home. This time, without paying any attention, he makes the trip in a moment. At his home they tell him that B arrived very early, immediately after A left, and that he even crossed with A on the threshold and wanted to remind him of the business, but that A replied that he had no time and that he should leave immediately. Despite this incomprehensible behavior, B entered the house to wait for his return. And I'd asked many times if I hadn't come back yet, but I was still waiting for him in room A. Happy to talk to B and explain everything that happened, A runs up stairs. Almost as soon as he gets there he stumbles, twists a tendon and almost loses his sense of smell, unable to scream, groaning in the dark, he hears B - perhaps far away already, perhaps next to him - coming down the stairs furiously and getting lost forever.
