And all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air came to him in pairs, and he spoke to them. They listened to him with joy, gathering at his side, and did not leave until late at night, when the hermit dismissed them, entrusting them to the wind and the forest with his blessing. One afternoon, while he was talking about love, a leopard raised his head and said to the hermit, \"You're talking about love. Tell us, sir, where is your companion? \"I have no companion\", replied the hermit. Then a great cry of astonishment came from the choir of beasts and birds, and they began to say to one another, \"How can he speak to us about love and fellowship when he himself knows nothing about it? And slowly, with contemptuous attitude, they abandoned him. That night the hermit fell on his mat, face down to the ground, and wept bitterly and clapped his hands against his chest.
