I beg you to accept my claim. The prince answered, \"The king has made me a great honor and an advantageous offer. But I have received my land from my ancestral princes and I wish to keep it until the end. I cannot consent to that change. The King was very angry, and the Prince sent Tang Tsu as ambassador. And the king said to him, The prince will not change his land ten times more. If your lord retains his little fief, when I have destroyed great countries, it is because until now I have considered him a worthy man and have not taken care of him. But if you now reject your own convenience, you really mock me. Tang Tsu replied, \"It's not that. The Prince wants to preserve his grandparents' inheritance. If thou offerest him a territory twenty times, and not ten times, he shall refuse it. The King was furious and said to Tang Tsu, \"Do you know what a king's anger is? - No, said Tang Tsu. \"It's millions of corpses and blood flowing like a river a thousand leagues round\", said the King. Tang Tsu then asked, \"Do you know your Majesty what the anger of a simple private person is? The king said, \"The anger of a private? It's losing your badge of dignity and walking barefoot with your head against the floor. \"No\", said Tang Tsu, \"that is the anger of a mediocre man, not that of a brave man. When a brave man is forced to rage, like there are only two bodies here, blood runs barely five steps away. And yet, all of China is dressed up in mourning. Today is that day. And he rose up, unwrapping the sword. The king waited a while, greeted him humbly and said, \"Teacher, sit down\". What's the point of this? I got it.
