When he learned that recently young artists were exercising on putting their heads down, they said that to rehearse a new vision, Meng Hsie immediately practiced this exercise as well. And he tempted him a little, and said to his disciples, When I bow down, the world appears to me in a new and more beautiful form. This was discussed, and the young artists were not too proud that the old master had thus backed their experiments. He was known to be barely a speaker, teaching his disciples not by doctrine but by his simple presence and example. That is why their demonstrations were so popular and spread everywhere. Soon after his words had delighted the innovators and surprised and even indignant many of the ancients, it was known that he had spoken again. And they said, It is good for a man to have two legs; for he that is bowed down with his head is not good for health. And when you incorporate the one who was head down the world is represented twice as beautiful as before. These words of the teacher shocked the young antipodists, who felt betrayed or mocked, and also the Mandarines. \"One day Meng Hsie says such a thing, and the next day he says the opposite\", the Mandarines said. It's impossible for both to be true. Who listens to the elder when his mind is weak? Some went to tell the master what both the innovators and the Mandarines said about him. He just laughed. And when his followers demanded an explanation, he said, \"The reality exists, my children, and that is incontrovertible. Truths, on the other hand, that is, opinions about reality expressed by words, are many, and they are all as true as they are false. They kept on asking, but they could not get him to say anything.", "title": "Leyenda china", "author": "Hermann Hesse"}
