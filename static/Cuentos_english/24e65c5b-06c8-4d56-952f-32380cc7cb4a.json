This came to the ears of a poor gentleman, very skilled in the black arts, who summoned an evil spirit and conjured it to tell where the soul of Count Ludwig rested. The devil swore to the knight, by the Supreme and by his terrible judgment, that he would lead him to the siege and return him safe and sound. In hell, he saw horrible places and punishments of all kinds. They got to where a terrible devil was sitting on a hole. At the request of his guide, he removed the burning lid, introduced a bronze trumpet and played it so loudly that the knight thought the whole universe was shaking. In a moment, the abyss spat out sulfur flames and, along with the sparks, the Count rose. Then the gentleman said, \"Your son wants to know about your condition and if he can help you in any way. Ludwig said that his condition was evident, but that the torments of his soul could be mitigated if his son returned such and such properties, of which he had unjustly appropriated. As the gentleman indicated that the Count would not believe him, Ludwig gave him a signal that only he and his son knew. Then he sank into the abyss before the eyes of the knight, whom the devil took back. He didn't lose his life, but he was so pale and weak that he was barely recognized. And it came to pass after a few days that he delivered the words of his father unto the son; but the sentenced man was of little use to him, for he would not deliver his goods. I recognize the signs and I have no doubt you've seen my father. He will not deprive you of the reward promised. \"Keep your house\", said the gentleman. From now on, I will only think of the salvation of my soul. He stripped himself of everything and became a Cistercian monk.
