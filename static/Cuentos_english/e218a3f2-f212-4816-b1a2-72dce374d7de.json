But the wolf, one of those days, did come. The shepherd, now frightened himself, cried out in terror, \"Please come and help me, the wolf is killing the sheep\". But no one paid attention to his cries, much less thought of coming to his aid. And the wolf, seeing that there was no cause to fear evil, wounded and destroyed the whole flock according to his desire. A liar is never believed, even when he speaks the truth.", "title": "El joven y el lobo", "author": "nan Esopo"}
