Do you think your royal rank scares me or intimidates me? More fat than you is the Beef, and I drive it to my will. He says, and he himself plays the attack, trumpet and paladin at the same time. He's back, he's running, and he's running over the lion's neck. The beast roars, flashes her pupils, fills her mouth with spumacrabs. Great alarm in those outlines; everyone trembles, everyone hides; and the general panic is the work of a mosquito! The tiny insect harasses the king animal everywhere; as soon as it bites into its rough back as well as its wet snout, or it gets into its nose. Then the lion's fury comes to a head. And her invisible enemy triumphs and laughs, seeing that neither the fangs nor the claws are enough for the angry beast to bite and scratch. The king of the forest woundeth himself, and tears himself; he smiteth his flanks with the resonating tail; he smiteth the air with no more power; and his own fury fatigueth him, and smiteth him. The Mosquito retreats from the triumphant and glorious fight: with the same clarity that announced the attack, he proclaims victory; runs to publish everywhere the new fable; but he hits the ambush of a spider, and there all his exploits end. What lessons does this fable teach us? Two things I see in it: first, that the most fearsome enemy is usually the smallest; second, that after overcoming the greatest dangers, we sometimes succumb to the smallest obstacle.
