In his town the police asked him his name, but he could not remember it, he, distracted by all the things that deserved his attention, had forgotten it. Then they put him in jail, they stamped him, and after all the diligence was over, they sentenced him ten times to death for ten mysterious crimes of which the perpetrator had not been found, and they killed him once, but in a definitive way, because there was nothing else to do. He, the poor man who had not committed any of the crimes he was accused of, even repented in the end. Justice breathed, because, although it had only killed the unfortunate good man who did not remember his last name, it had managed to solve those crimes that could not go unpunished and had given its truth to the axiom that justice sooner or later triumphs.
