Silent and submissive, the boatman began to row diligently. Suddenly a flock of birds was flying up into the sky. The young man asked the ship's captain, \"Man, have you studied the life of birds?\" - No, sir - replied the boatman. - So, buddy, you've lost a quarter of your life. A few minutes later, the boat slid alongside exotic plants floating in the river waters. The young man asked the sailor, \"Tell me, sailor, have you studied botany? - No, sir, I don't know anything about plants. \"I must tell you, you have lost half your life\", said the young petulant. The boatman continued to row patiently. The midday sun reflected brightly over the river's waters. And the young man said to him, Surely, ship-owner, thou hast been drifting for many years on the water. Do you know, by the way, anything about the nature of water? - No, sir, I don't know anything about it. I don't know anything about these waters or any of the others. - Oh, my friend! - exclaimed the young man. You really lost three-quarters of your life. Suddenly, the boat started to turn into water. There was no way to shrink that much water and the boat started sinking. \"Sir, \" the owner of the boat asked\", can you swim?\" - No, the young man replied. - Well, I'm afraid, sir, you've lost your whole life.
