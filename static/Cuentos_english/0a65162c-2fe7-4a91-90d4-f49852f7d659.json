At noon they reached a wide river without a bridge to cross. They had to swim or find some other route they didn't know. And they said: \"We shall not know\". After all, the river is not that wide. And they went diving and swimming. And one of the men, who always knew of rivers and river routes, suddenly, in the middle of the stream, began to get lost and to be dragged by the raging waters; while, the other, who had never swum before, crossed the river in a straight line and stopped on a bank. Then, seeing his companion still struggling with the current, he threw himself back into the water and brought him safely to shore. And the man who had been dragged by the stream said, \"Didn't you say you couldn't swim? How did you cross the river so safely? \"Friend\", said the second man, \"see this belt I'm wearing? It's full of gold coins I made for my wife and kids, a whole year of work. It's the weight of this belt that led me across the river, toward my wife and my children. And my wife and kids were on my shoulders while I was swimming. And the two men continued their way together to Salamis. FIN", "title": "El oro", "author": "Gibr\u00e1n Jalil Gibr\u00e1n"}
