I smile when I see you playing with that wooden toy. I am busy doing the accounting, and I spend hours and hours adding up numbers. Maybe you look at me with a glint in your eye and think, \u201cWhat a waste of time to play a game like this!\u201d Little boy, the sand and the mud cakes are no longer dividing me; I have forgotten your art. I spend money on expensive entertainment and accumulate gold and silver. You play with a joyful heart with all you find. I dedicate my strength and my time to the conquest of things I never could obtain. In my fragile shack I try to cross the sea of ambition, and I forget that my work is also just a game.
