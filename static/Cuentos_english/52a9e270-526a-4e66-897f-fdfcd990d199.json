He had always been a drifter and enjoyed his way of life. But on one occasion he penetrated a palace whose walls were covered with mirrors. The dog ran into one of his glass rooms and instantly saw countless dogs running towards him in the opposite direction to his own. Landing, he turned right to try to run away, but then he noticed that there were also large numbers of dogs in that direction. He turned left and began to bark in fear. Dozens of dogs, on the left, barked threateningly. He felt he was surrounded by angry dogs and he had no escape. He looked in all directions and in all he saw enemy dogs who kept barking at him. At that moment terror paralyzed his heart and he died a victim of anguish. FIN", "title": "El perro aterrado y la percepci\u00f3n err\u00f3nea", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
