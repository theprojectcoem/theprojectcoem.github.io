I know the place, it's not deep, so I decided to save it as soon as there was a little more audience. I sat in a bank waiting. The boy heard how beautifully he shouted, so soon a large group of people gathered on the shore. I waited a little longer for the audience to be complete, so I got up, approached the water, and excited by the shouts of admiration, I slowly took off my left shoe. The audience applauded me. I was already in socks when I realized that a shameless man was also getting ready to strip. I got mad. I was here first, I told him. And he said, \"Is that your boy listening or what?\" And he started to take off his vest. You're right! Some voices were made heard among the audience. The boy who listens is everyone's! Put those pants down, I told you. You weren't even in this world when I was saving kids. \"You'll have saved your grandmother\", he replied in an insulting tone. And you to your aunt. Go make fists and leave the listening kid alone. The audience was increasing. Some were on my side, others said everyone has the right to save children who listen. I saw things get complicated and it all depended on who got naked first. Although he had started later, as he was wearing a crematorium caught up with me. I beat him only when I got to the panties. Seeing that he was missing his chance, he wanted to jump into the water as he was, in underwear. My blood started to burn and I threw the stitch. For being the hero! I don't know what happened to the boy listening because we were taken to the ER. I dislocated his arm and he broke my teeth. Saving those who drown requires courage and sacrifice.
