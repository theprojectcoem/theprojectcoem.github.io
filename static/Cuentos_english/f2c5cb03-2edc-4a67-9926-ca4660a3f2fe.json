Three days later, one of them died. The survivor dug a pit in the snow about a hundred yards from the cabin and buried the body. The next day, however, upon waking up from his first peaceful sleep, he found him again inside the house, dead and petrified by the ice, but sitting as a formal visitor in front of his bed. He buried him again, perhaps in a more distant tomb, but when he awoke the next day he found him again sitting in front of his bed. Then he lost his mind. The diary he had kept up to that time made it possible to know the truth of his story. Among the many explanations they tried to give to the riddle, one seemed the most plausible: the survivor had felt so affected by his loneliness that he himself dug up the corpse he buried awake as he slept.
