One, loaded with sponges, was as light as a post; the other, by the way, was oxen's load: its load was salt. And they came to the ford of a river, and they were in great haste. The rearman, who passed by that ford every day, rode on the donkey of the sponges, waving before the other animal. It was this bumpy, and going from here to there, he fell into a hole, rose again, stumbled again, and took so much water, that the salt was dissolving, and soon felt the back relieved of all load. His buddy, the one with the sponges, wanted to follow his example, like a donkey in a cage. He dived into the river, and they all became waterlogged: the donkey, the rear, and the sponges. These became so heavy, that poor riding couldn't win the shore. The poor backsman was hugging his neck, waiting for death. Fortunately, he came to his aid I don't know who, but what happened is enough to understand that it is not right for everyone to act the same way. And that's the conclusion of the fable.
