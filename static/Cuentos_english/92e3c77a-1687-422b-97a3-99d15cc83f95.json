His mother watched him from the window come and go through the dirt paths, with his hands still, like falls to the sides of the body. The boy didn't like the chill-colored toys, the ball, so round, and the trucks, with their wheels, he didn't like. He looked at them, touched them, and then went to the garden, to the roofless ground, with his pallid, not very clean handles, sloping by the body like two strange mute bells. The mother looked restlessly at the child, who came and went with a shadow between his eyes. If the kid liked to play I wouldn't be cold watching him go and come. But the father said, cheerfully: \"He can't play, he's not an ordinary kid. He's a child who thinks. One day the mother cocked herself up and followed the child, under the rain, hiding among the trees. When the boy reached the edge of the pond, he bent down, looking for crickets, worms, frog cubs and worms. I was putting them in a box. Then he sat down on the floor, and one by one he took them out. With his dirty, almost black nails, he made a slight crackling noise, and he slashed their heads. FIN", "title": "El ni\u00f1o que no sab\u00eda jugar", "author": "Ana Mar\u00eda Matute"}
