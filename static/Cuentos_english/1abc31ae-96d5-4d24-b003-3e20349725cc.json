As he was a dreamer, he liked to lie down in a field near the palace and dream, with his eyes glued to the blue sky. Because in those pastures the flowers were bigger and more beautiful than anywhere else. And the prince dreamed of white, very white, castles with huge windows and brightly-shaded gardens. But one day the old king died and the prince was his successor. And the new king often wore white robes, very white robes, with huge eyes. And he dreamed of a small pasture, where the flowers were larger and more beautiful than anywhere else. FIN", "title": "Leyenda", "author": "Bertolt Brecht"}
