On another occasion he stole a watch that he also gave to his mother. She also accepted the robbery. So the years passed and the young man turned into a dangerous thief. But one day, caught at the time of the robbery, his hands were tied behind his back and he was taken to prison, while his mother followed him, beating her chest.
