Wake up at two or three in the morning with several egrets in a line, it was almost a habit. Even the children were accustomed to that routine. A Parisian friend began to realize this adaptation when a strong explosion woke his five-year-old son, who was sleeping in his bed. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked.
