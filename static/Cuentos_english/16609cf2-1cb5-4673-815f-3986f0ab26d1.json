Can you give me something to eat? \"There in that nail you can hang your things\", the old woman replied. - Hey, you! Are you wearing a blindfold? Yes, you can go to bed. \"Wait a minute, you wicked witch. I will cure you of your deafness\", said the soldier, putting his fists through his eyes. Stop joking and put the coat on the table! If I have nothing, son. Make me a soup! \"The soldier replied. But with what, my son? Then give me an axe. I'll do it with her. What a strange thing! \"He said to himself, the old woman. Let's see how an axe makes a soup! But, in the end, he brought the axe. The soldier took it and put it in a pot and set it on fire, and we already have the hot axe you'll boil. The soldier then tried the water with a spoon and said, \"The soup would be good if I poured some barley on it\". And the old lady brought the barley. The soldier threw it in the pot. He tried it and said, \"Perfectly! All you need is a little butter. The old lady brought it. The pot followed the fire with that extra. After a while, the soldier said to the old woman, \"Now bring us bread and salt, two plates and two spoons and let's eat\". They didn't leave a single drop in the pot. But when are we going to eat the axe? \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry\". The old woman asked. \"It's not quite cooked yet\", replied the soldier. I will cook it on the way; it shall be my breakfast tomorrow. He put her in his sack, said goodbye to the old woman and left for another town.", "title": "Sopa de hacha", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
