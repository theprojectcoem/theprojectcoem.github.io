The Mastin of the Baskervilles, the Cisne of Saint Saens and Moby Dick of Melville were missing with notice; without notice, the Mosses of Sartre and the Truce of Schubert. They were present: the Loro of Flaubert, the Asno of Burid\u00e1n, the Paloma of Picasso, the Centaurs of Daro, the Cord of Poe, the Rinoceronte of Ionesco and the Visions of Arist\u00f3fanes. In the Order of the Day there was one single point: the designation of Rinoceronte de Ionesco as the President of the Day. The Centaur (Orneo) of Daro began saying: \u201cI understand the secret of the beast.\u201d The Asno of Burid\u00e1n did not speak a word but gave the understanding that neither was nor was. The Loro of Flaubert had a tripartite and insolitary intervention: \u201cCoco, my little coco\u201d, \u201cHave you eaten, Jako?\u201d, \u201cI have a good cigar\u201d. Another Centaur (Caumantes) of Daro supported his congener Orneo: \u201cThe monster expresses an itch from the heart of Orb.\u201d The Rinoceronte of Ionesco slowly moved the pale and tanned skin, as a subtle way of letting himself be licked. The Paloma of Picasso flew in and her brief excrement fell as a decisive comment on the candidate\u2019s impenetrable test. However, the proposal of the Dareans floated in the air, so that the Angels of Arist\u00f3fona pronounced in the chapel: \"No, never, never, while I live a drop of life.\" The Loro of Flaubert, reiterating, tried to intervene: \"Coco, my little coco,\" but the Cord of Poe finally opened his mouth. Everyone cried, even the lord. The Cordon said, \"Nevermore.\"", "title": "Bestiario", "author": "Mario Benedetti"}
