It never takes over an entire rat unless a preconception of each of its parts has been formed. The current of the food that throbs in their claws is being passed through the consciousness and prelude the analytical operation of a slow intestinal development. We are faced with a case of deep reflective assimilation. With the sharp penetration of its forks, the owl grasps the object directly and develops its peculiar theory of knowledge. The thing itself (rider, reptile or volatile) is delivered to you we don't know how. Perhaps through the invisible burst of momentary intuition; perhaps thanks to a logical wait, since we always imagine the owl as a still, introverted subject and little given to the kinetic effusions of chase and capture. Who can guarantee that for the ideal creatures there are no shadow labyrinths, dark syllogisms that will appear in the void after the brief clause of the peak? Understanding the owl is like accepting this premise. A harmonious chapter of carved feathers that supports a Greek metaphor; a sinister shadow clock that marks in the spirit an hour of medieval witchcraft: this is the bi-fronted image of the bird that takes flight at sunset and is the best vinegar for Western philosophy books. \u266a Fin's the Beast \u266a 1959", "title": "El b\u00faho", "author": "Juan Jos\u00e9 Arreola"}
