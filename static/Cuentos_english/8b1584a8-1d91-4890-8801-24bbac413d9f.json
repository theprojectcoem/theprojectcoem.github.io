Hundred-year-old pins. And not just birds. Hundred-year-old and very high peaks. And not just lakes. Pine and pine and pine. Florido, birdman and lake, the world of Juan Girador. He was born there, he grew up there, he never left his father's side, who was also a spinner; he didn't take his own wife or stranger and he inherited in him the magic of wrappings and sunflowers. His father died, and he buried him without burial, more out of the ground than in the ground, so as not to depart from his side. And she took care of it, until it became bones, from the picotace or the lace of animals that feed on corpses. Day and night he cared for his dead father. He sat down on the tree trunk for days and nights and when the dead Girador's belly burst, he took off his navel, a cry between cardinal and violet, which he wrapped in four-colored silks. Black silk first, then red silk, then green silk, and finally yellow silk. When the wrapper was finished, it weighed and it was like a sunflower. He buried the deepest white bones and left wearing a scapular, over his chest, wrapped in colorful silks, the dead man's spinning navel.
