Every morning he left the village, and when he returned at night, all the workers of the village, having slept all day, gathered around him and said: \"Look, see, what have you seen today?\" He explained: - I saw a faun in the forest with a flute and he was obliged to dance to a rustle of silvans. - Keep on counting, what more have you seen? - said the men. -When I arrived at the shore of the sea I saw, at the crest of the waves, three sirens, whose green hair was adorned with gold thread. And the men appreciated him because he told them stories. One morning he left his village, as he did every morning... But when he reached the shore of the sea, there he saw three sirens, three sirens who, at the crest of the waves, sprayed their green hair with gold. And as he continued his walk, nearing the forest, he saw a faun snorting his flute and a swarm of wolves... That night, when he returned to his village, they asked him, \"Look, see, what have you seen?\" He replied: - I have seen nothing.
