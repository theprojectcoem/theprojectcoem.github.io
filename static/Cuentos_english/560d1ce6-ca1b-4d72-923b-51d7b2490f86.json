A tangled post on the ground, a young man tied to it, dressed in dark trousers and a shirt, his hair very short. Two or three American officers are near, one of them lights a cigarette, then a doctor approaches saying he doesn't know what, while the defendant, with the cigarette attached to his lips, aspirates and swallows a mouthful of smoke. A few seconds more and everyone is gone, we don't see the soldiers that are going to shoot, you would say that the camera is in the middle of the grenade launcher. The body suddenly is shattered by the blows, jerks a little along the post, but is not dead: it shakes weakly. The officers approach, one of them seems to be holding a gun, maybe he will give him the grace shot, you will never know, the image has ended. It was said that the Italian was not a soldier, that he had been, with others, launched in parachutes behind the lines of the United States for acts of sabotage, which the so-called laws of war seem to not forgive. All this is horrible, but I don\u2019t know why, the ecstatic ritual of the last cigarette of the condemned man sticks in my memory more than anything else, as if each of those men were playing a role: the priest to give the sacrament, the condemned man who asks or accepts the cigarette, the hand that lights it, probably the same hand that fires the last shot. The other side of tragedy is often the joke. FIN", "title": "El otro lado de la tragedia", "author": "Jos\u00e9 Saramago"}
