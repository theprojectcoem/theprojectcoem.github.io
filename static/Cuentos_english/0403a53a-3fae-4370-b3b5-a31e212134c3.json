They were two solemn hypocrites who compensated well for travel expenses by killing chickens and stealing cheeses. The road was long and tedious: they argued over how to make it short. Arguing is a great resource; without it we'd always fall asleep. They discussed for a long time, and then they talked about each other. Finally the bitch told the cat. - You pretend to be very clever and you don't know as much as I do. I have a bag full of schemes and schemes. - I don't carry more than one in my forks, but it's worth a thousand. And back to the dispute. That yes, that no, they were giving it to give it, when a bullshit ended their fight. And the cat said to the fox, Seek in thy sack, and in thy foolish lies seek a sure way out; for I have it. And saying so, he grabbed himself nicely to the nearest tree. The fox made a thousand turns and revolts, all useless; she went into a hundred corners, escaped a hundred times from the brave dogs, tried every conceivable asylum, and found no refuge in any pit; the smoke made her come out of them all, and two agile dogs strangled her at last. Sometimes you lose a business overload of records and resources; you waste time looking for the best, testing this, the other, and the afterlife. It's better to have only one way out, but good.
