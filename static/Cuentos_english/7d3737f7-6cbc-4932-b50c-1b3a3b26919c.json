They had already traveled through many lands when they came to a stream that had no bridge and could not cross it. Finally, the straw bush found its solution: it would stretch over the stream between the two banks and the other would pass over it, first the brass and then the green jewel. The blaze began to cross slowly and widely; the green Jew followed her through short passages. But when the fire reached the middle of the straw bush, it started to burn and burned. The stove fell into the water, made a pssshhh... and died. The straw-bush, broken in two, was carried away by the current. The green Jewess, who was going a little further back, slipped too and fell, although she could swim a little. In the end, however, she had to swallow so much water that it burst and, in that state, was dragged to shore. Fortunately, there was a tailor sitting there, resting from his pilgrimage. With a needle and thread in his hand, he sewed it up and left it whole again. Ever since then, every green Jew has a thread. According to another account, the first to pass over the straw bush was the green Jewess, who came without difficulty to the other side and observed the fire approaching her from the opposite shore. In the middle of the water burning like a straw, he fell and made a pssssssssssshhhh... Seeing it, the green Jewess laughed so hard that she burst out. The tailor on the shore sewed her and left her whole again, but at the time she had only black thread and that's why all green jewels have a black thread.
