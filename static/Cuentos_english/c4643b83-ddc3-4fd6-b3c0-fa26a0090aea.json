The secret, however, was revealed by an ogre to a captive princess, who pretended to fear that this was not immortal. Ogres don't die, the ogre said to reassure her. We are not immortal, but our death depends on a secret that no human being will guess. I'll tell you so you don't suffer. Look at that pond: at its deepest, in the center, there is a glass pillar, on top of which, underwater, lie two bees. If a man can dive into the water and return to the land with the bees and give them freedom, all the ogres will die. But who's gonna guess this secret? Don't be sorry; you can consider me immortal. The princess revealed the secret to the hero. He freed the bees and all the ogres died, each in his palace. FIN", "title": "La aniquilaci\u00f3n de los ogros", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
