He returned to his homeland and one day met the abbot and told him to sell him, at whatever price, the stone that was between such and such as the column of the monastery's oratory. What do you need it for? The abbot asked. I want to put it on my bed, because it has the property that an insomniac needs only to put his head on it to fall asleep immediately. This was done by the Devil during his fasting fast; every time he went to the church to pray and sat on the stone, he was struck by sleep.
