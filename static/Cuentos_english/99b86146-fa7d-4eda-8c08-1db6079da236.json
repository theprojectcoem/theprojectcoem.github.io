Affectionately known for his flamboyant elegance in Sheridan's comedies at the Drury Lane Theatre, and vilified in London society for the eruptions of his irascible character. One night, in a pub, the critic Stewart tried to laugh at that double personality of knight in fiction and energy in reality. They talked. A hard word provoked another even harder, and at last Turpin, out of his mind and contradicting himself, shouted to Stewart: - I will prove to you that I am capable of behaving in life with the decorum of the art! Stewart could not test it because, in one of his irrepressible rages, he shot him dead there with a pistol, but he did test it before the world at his first opportunity. A witness describes the scene as follows: The actor Turpin, from the top of the screen, looks at the audience. He thinks: \u201cToday, in this tragedy like Richard Cumberland, I will play the part of the condemned man with all my soul.\u201d And, indeed, it is the best representation of his brilliant theatrical career. He advances with his hands clasped behind his back, his tense body, his proud head, until a scotch tape is slipped over his feet and Turpin, in the courtyard of Newgate Prison, is hung from the gallows.
