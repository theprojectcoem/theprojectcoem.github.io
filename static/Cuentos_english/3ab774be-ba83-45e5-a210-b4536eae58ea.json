When he went out hunting he went with the hunting dog, and if he caught any prey, on his return, the owner gave a piece to the guard dog. Displeased with this, the hunting dog reproached his companion: that he was the only one who went out and suffered at all times, while the other dog, the caregiver, did nothing, enjoying his hunting work. And the watchman's dog answered and said, It is not to me that thou shalt make a complaint, but to our lord; for he hath taught me to live quietly in the work of others, and not to teach me thy manner of working. Have your elders teach you a dignified job to face your future.", "title": "Los dos perros", "author": "nan Esopo"}
