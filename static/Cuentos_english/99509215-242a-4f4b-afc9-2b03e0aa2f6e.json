They don't care if they don't know math, they don't care if they write numbers absurdly, they don't suffer when they erase the magnificent operations that have so hardly been done. The only thing they're worried about is that he's perverting numbers. Already the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which is of unlimited purity, had a discussion about the perversion of certain numbers, and protested that the 606 has been destroyed, because it can no longer be accepted as an example nor even serves for phones, and the 606 of the long streets has had to be replaced by the 605 duplicate. If this were to continue the great men of the science of numbers have said we could no longer account for and, for example, the budgets of a nation could not be constructed. Although some people may not mind that there are no budgets, what the mathematicians say is fine and humanity must refrain from further perverting numbers, for that they have all the words bloomed; but numbers! At least we'll put numbers against numbers, build the antidotes, and 69 against 63, which is normal.
