The eldest was a vigorous giant, the youngest a little humpback, the two girls were beautiful. Since the giant felt his strength, he slept with his two sisters and was served by the little humpback. Of her two sisters, one was her cook; the other, her gardener. When the giant wanted to sleep, he began by chaining his little brother the hump to a tree, and when he ran away, he caught him by four strokes and beat him twenty times with ox-nerves. The humpback became submissive and became the world's greatest vassal. The giant, content to see him fulfill his vassal duties, allowed him to sleep with one of his sisters, of whom he was already tired. The children born of this marriage were not entirely humpbacked, but they had a rather contracted figure. They were raised in the fear of God and the giant. They received an excellent education; they were taught that their uncle was a giant by divine right, that he could make his family what he wanted; that if he had a beautiful niece, or granddaughter, it would be for him alone without difficulty, and that no one could sleep with her if he did not want to. Dead the giant, his son, who was neither much less strong nor as tall as he, believed, however, to be a giant, like his father, by divine right. He intended to make all men work for him and sleep with all the young women. His family formed a coalition against him, was defeated and a republic was constituted.
