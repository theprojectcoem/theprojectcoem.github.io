Through the narrow Countess's Lane, two floats have been found. None of them backs down to get the other one through. - Farewell to the noble lord Don Juan de Padilla and Guzm\u00e1n, Marquis of Santa Fe de Guardiola, hearer of the Royal Audience of Mexico! -To Don Agustin de Echeverz and Subiza, Marquis of the Villa de San Miguel de Aguayo, whose ancestors fought for his Caesarean Majesty in Hungary, Transylvania and Perpignan! - By grandfather I was fond of Don Manuel Ponce de Le\u00f3n, who took the glove of Dona Ana from the lioness! - My great-grandfather Garcilaso de la Vega rescued the Hail Mary from the mule who was carrying her tied to the tail of his bride! Three days and nights pass and the bloodline of the Jewish magnates are still there, without one giving way to the other. After these three days - and so that neither lineage would suffer stain - the viceroy ordered the floats to retreat at the same time, and one turned towards San Andr\u00e9s and the other was down the street of the San Francisco Bridge.
