Sometimes they float \u2014 tiny winglets of air \u2014 and reproduce on the sky, with the tip of the wing, the broken ring, the shattered face of the city. Benedictine returns to the first, and is put to call her lover. See a spool of music that he is carrying in his bag. The wheel spins wildly, and a few squeaks \u2014 like the squeak of a needle \u2014 shake the whole raft. So he opens the tin and tinkles, victim of his own song, good poet at the tin. Finally, Pussecafe returns to his side. Jump like a clown on the rope, jump, jump. Jump over Benedictine \u2013 jump up in the air! And Benedictine sucks the plums, and shoots again the musical arrow that he has in the sack. FIN 1917", "title": "Las dos golondrinas", "author": "Alfonso Reyes"}
