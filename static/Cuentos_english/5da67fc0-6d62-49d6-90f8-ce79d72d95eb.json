The cronophones, on the other hand, those disordered and tibios, leave the memories scattered about the house, among shrill cries, and they walk about in the middle, and when one of them comes running, they caress him with tenderness and say, Do not harm yourself, and also: Beware of the stairs. That is why the houses of the famas are ordered and quiet, while those of the cronopios have great thuds and doors that slam. Neighbors always complain about the newspapers, and the famalies look thoughtfully and see if the labels are all in place.
