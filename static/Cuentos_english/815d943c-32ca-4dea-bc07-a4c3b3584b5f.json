Salute from the front, without pride, for the slave cannot have it; without joy, for the condemned cannot rejoice. Heal so that the law does not fail those to whom the law fails. But after greeting, the cloak that will not serve him in battle is slung over his chest. If the defeated one dies, and the victor who kills, with this, confessing to be defeated, one is declared the victor. FIN", "title": "Otra lecci\u00f3n", "author": "Fernando Pessoa"}
