And he went about the world seeking bronze, for only bronze could conceive his work. But the bronze of the whole world had disappeared; in part of the whole world there was no bronze, except the bronze of the image of the \u201cpain that lasts forever.\u201d It was he who had fashioned this image with his own hands, and had placed it on the grave of the only one he had loved in life. On the grave of the one he had loved most in life, and had died, he had placed this hewn image of himself, as a garment and sign of human love that never dies, and as a symbol of human pain that lasts forever. And there was not a single bronze in the whole world like the bronze in this picture. And he took the image that he had formed, and put it in a great furnace, and gave it to the fire. And with the bronze of the image of \u201cpain that lasts forever\u201d he carved an image of \u201cplace that is placed for an instant\u201d. FIN", "title": "El artista", "author": "Oscar Wilde"}
