Her slender body served as a model for Praxiteles, one of her many lovers, to make the statue of the goddess Aphrodite known as Venus of Cnidus and, during a feast, she let loose her hair, stripped herself naked and plunged into the sea, inspiring the painter Apeles to paint her famous Afrodite Anadiomene (Venus coming out of the sea, with her arms raised and her hands collecting from both sides her hair). On one occasion, after repeatedly rejecting the requests and requests of a certain Eutychus, he denounced her, accusing her of impiety by desecrating the Eleusinian mysteries, annual initiation rites to the cult of the agricultural goddesses Demeter and Persephone held at Eleusis, near Athens. Mnesareth appeared before the court of the heliologists - ancient magistrates of Athens - and, when she was about to be condemned to death, a famous orator named Hipperides spoke in her defense. His beautiful and inflamed plea in favor of the accused did not however move the jury members. In a last and desperate attempt, Hipperides stripped the accused of the peplos and presented her naked before the court, while exclaiming: \"Forget, if you like, all my previous arguments. But wouldn't they regret condemning to death the goddess Aphrodite herself? Mercy for beauty! So convincing and irrefutable was the argument that Frin\u00e9, acquitted of all charges by the court, was immediately released.
