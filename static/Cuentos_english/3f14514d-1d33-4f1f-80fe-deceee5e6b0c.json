Tired of the tedious shooting of the white man who practiced shooting his pebbles against empty cans or bottle pieces, David found it much more fun to exercise against the birds the skill God had endowed him with, so from then on he undertook it with all who were within his reach, especially against Sparrows, Hounds, Smurfs and Whigs, whose bloody little bodies fell gently on the grass, with his heart still agitated by the fear and violence of the stone. David rushed to them in joy and buried them in a Christian way. When David's parents learned of his good son's habit they were very alarmed, told him what it was, and harmed his conduct in such harsh and convincing terms that, with tears in his eyes, he admitted his guilt, sincerely repented, and for a long time applied himself exclusively to shooting at the other children. Dedicated years later to the militia, in World War II David was promoted to general and decorated with the highest crosses for killing only thirty-six men, and later degraded and shot for letting an enemy messenger pigeon escape alive.
