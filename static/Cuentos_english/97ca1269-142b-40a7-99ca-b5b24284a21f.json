But at least it relieves them of the need to get out of the ants in search of natural vegetables. That way they're saved from fire, poison, insecticidal clouds. Since the number of ants is a constantly growing number, over time there are so many ants underground that the ants need to be expanded. The galleries expand, intersect, eventually become confused into a single Great Ant under the direction of a single Great Ant. The exits outside are lined with lime and singing. Generations follow. Since they have never crossed the boundaries of the Great Hornbill, they make the logical mistake of identifying it with the Great Universe. But sometimes an ant strayed through a ruined corridor, saw a distant light, flashes, approached and discovered an exit mouth whose closure had collapsed. With a beating heart, the ant comes out to the surface of the earth. Go in the morning. Go to a garden. See stems, leaves, buds, shoots, petals, stems, dew. Look at a yellow rose. All your instincts suddenly wake up. He jumps on the plants and starts cutting, cutting and eating. It's a stakeout. Then, regretting, he decides to return to the Great Hornblower with the news. He searches for his sisters, tries to explain what he has seen, shouts: Up... light... garden... leaves... green... flowers... The other ants don't understand a single word of that delusional language, they think the ant has gone crazy and kill her. (Written by Pavel Vodnik the day before he committed suicide. The text of the fable appeared in issue 12 of Szpilki magazine and earned its director, Jerzy Kott, a fine of one hundred znacks.)
