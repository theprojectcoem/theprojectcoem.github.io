All I had to do was connect to it and press a few buttons to get a little paperwork out of the computer with the current assessment of my health and my existential potential. I took the computer home, plugged it in, and I pressed the buttons. A little paper came out of the computer: \"What's that clown still doing there?\" I guessed it was me, and I didn't like the way he addressed me. I took the computer to the store. Don't you have a better educated man than this? I asked the salesman. Don't be surprised, it's a very sensitive instrument. No wonder he reacts in desperate cases by overloading the network. It's the same, I don't like being offended. Can't you adjust it a little bit? But the only thing I got was the computer became ironic. The next piece of paper with the diagnosis said, \"Are you still alive?\" I asked for it to be fixed, I complained again at the store. \"You can't do that anymore\", said the salesman. I squeezed the screw to the top. What if he gets hit with a hammer? I'll try it. You want to hit me with a hammer, corpse? I got my computer spotted. I threw the computer away and bought myself a mirror. Cheap and easy to handle, it'll always tell if I'm pink or pale. And most of all, it's not insulting.
