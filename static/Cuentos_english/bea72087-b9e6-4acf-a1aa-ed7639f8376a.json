He will dream that Alonso Quijano can be Don Quijote without leaving his village and his books. You will dream that a vision of Olympus can be more poetic than the poem that narrates their works. He will dream of generations of humans who will not recognize the name of Moses. You will dream more precise dreams than the vigil of today. You will dream that we can do miracles and that we don't, because it will be more real to imagine them. Dream worlds so intense that the voice of one of its birds could kill you. You will dream that forgetting and remembering can be voluntary, not a slap in the face or a gift from the gods. He will dream that we shall see with all the body, as Milton wished from the shadow of those sweet bushes, the eyes. You will dream of a world without machines and without that dreadful machine, the body. Life is not a dream but it can become a dream, writes Novalis.
