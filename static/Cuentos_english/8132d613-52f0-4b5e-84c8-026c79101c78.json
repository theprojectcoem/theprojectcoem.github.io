One of them asked the other, \"What have you been composing lately, and how does it sound on your lyre?\" The other poet proudly replied, \"I have just finished the greatest of my poems, perhaps the greatest poem ever written in Greece. It's an invocation of Olympian Zeus. And he took a papyrus from under his cloak, and said, Take it, I will take it with me, and I will read it unto you. Come, let's sit in the shadow of that white cypress. And the poet read his poem. And it was a long poem. \"It's a great poem\", said the other poet kindly. He will live through the years, and in him you will be glorified. - And you, what have you been writing these past few days? - asked the first gently. \"I've written little\", replied the other. Just eight lines in memory of a kid playing in a garden. And he recited his lines. - It's not bad. It's not bad\", said the first poet. And they split up. And today, after two thousand years, the eight lines of the poet are read in all languages, and they are loved and appreciated, and even though the other poem has also lived through the years in bookstores and in school texts, and despite being remembered, it is neither loved nor read.
