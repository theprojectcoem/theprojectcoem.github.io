A girl was running away, chased by a boy. The bottom of his robe had been lifted and the edge of his gauze pants could be seen. While running, he dropped a silver mirror. The boy picked up the mirror and looked at it. And he looked upon their eyes, and saw their wisdom, and loved their judgment; and he ceased his pursuit, and sat down in the sand. And the girl began to flee again, chased by a man in the strength of her age. He had lifted the bottom of his robe and his thighs were like the flesh of a fruit. In his career, a golden apple rolled from his lap. And the pursuer took the golden apple, and hid it under his robe, and worshipped it, and ceased his pursuit, and sat down in the sand. And the girl kept running, but her steps were less fast. Because she was being chased by a shaky old man. His robe had been lowered, and his ankles were wrapped in a colorful fabric. But as he ran, something strange happened, because one after another their breasts were unfurled, and they fell to the ground like ripe sharp spikes. The old man smelled them both, and the girl, before she jumped into the river that runs through the island of Scira, shouted two shouts of horror and sorrow.
