The other, offended, with nothing to say, wrote in the sand: \"Today my best friend slapped me in the face\". They went on and arrived at an oasis where they decided to bathe. The one who had been slapped and injured began to drown, being rescued by his friend. When he recovered, he took a stiletto and wrote on a stone: \"Today my best friend saved my life\". The friend asked, 'Why did you write on the sand, and now on a stone?' Smiling, the other friend replied, \"When a great friend offends us, we must write in the sand where the wind of forgetfulness and forgiveness will take care to erase and put it out; on the other hand, when something great happens to us, we must engrave it on the stone of the memory of the heart where no wind in the whole world can erase it.
