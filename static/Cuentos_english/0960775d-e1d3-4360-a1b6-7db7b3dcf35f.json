So the eagle chose a very tall tree to lay its eggs there, while the fox released its young under a few bushes on the ground, at the foot of the same tree. One day the fox went out to get her food, and the eagle, hungry, fell on the hedges, and carried the foxes, and then she and her young rejoiced with a feast. The fox came back and it hurt her more not being able to get revenge than hearing about the death of her little ones. How could she, being a land animal, unable to fly, chase a flying one? He had to settle for the usual comfort of the weak and powerless: curse his enemy from afar. But it wasn't long before the eagle got paid for his betrayal of friendship. And there were shepherds in the field slaughtering a goat; and the eagle fell upon it, and took a young sheaf that was still burning, and put it in its nest. A strong wind came and transmitted the fire to the strawberries, burning also their small spikes, which as small as they could not fly yet, which came to the ground. The fox then ran and quietly devoured all the stingers before the eyes of her enemy. Never betray sincere friendship, for sooner or later the punishment from heaven will come.", "title": "El \u00e1guila y la zorra", "author": "nan Esopo"}
