There were also maps in the reading book. They were not interested in Beltr\u00e1n either. Even the globular globe that hung in the hall, in front of the Director\u2019s desk, the only thing that attracted his attention was that one could turn it with one\u2019s finger: \u201cMaybe \u2014 he thought \u2014 there is a big finger that makes this planet turn; perhaps it is not even a finger, but someone is stroking it.\u201d Beltran was bored with maps. So it went on for two, three years. How was it that geography was soon discovered? The truth is that one afternoon, as he was laying stones on a rock, it occurred to him that all the school maps were worthless because they were too small, incomplete, fragmentary, scribbled, flimsy, uninhabitable. \"The real map - he said - is the planet itself; a map of another planet, equal but millions of times larger, inhabited by giants millions of times larger than men, where there is a child who gives a finger to a stone millions of times larger than the one I am giving a finger to now.\" Beltran paused and looked around. Everything seemed new to him: the square, the avenues, the river, the tree. It was characterized as a microbe that walks on the terracotta globe of the school foyer. \"Live - he said - on a map. But this map which seems so great to me must be inside a school I have not yet been able to see: and there, for another Beltr\u00e1n, it will be as small, incomplete, fragmentary, snatched, false and uninhabitable as the maps of my own school. One map is always within another. There will be one so great that it will coincide with the universe.\u201d FIN", "title": "Mapas", "author": "Enrique Anderson Imbert"}
