It was twelve o'clock, and a nun started lighting the red, pink, blue and yellow candles with that slow prosopopoeia that lights up the church spiders. In the round room, the nun in charge of waiting, full of nostalgia, saw the births she saw in her childhood, and her eyes were full of little lights. That's when the bell rang that someone had left a child in the loop. She turned around and saw a newborn appear lit up by a halo that sprang from it like the one that springs from the firefly. He didn't dare touch it and ran for the superior as if to warn her of a fire. She came back with her and they were equally dazzled. Who was that son of love that shone like that? Something made the solemnity of night and hour doubtful, but if that was a sacrilegious thought and all that was the work of Satan, they rejected the doubt. The bishop was notified, and among them all they decided to hide the glowing to avoid schism. FIN", "title": "Navidad", "author": "Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de la Serna"}
