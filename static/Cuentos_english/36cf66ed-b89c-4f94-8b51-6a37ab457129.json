This neighbor had the most exquisite gifts Pomona can give to man. Each season paid tribute to it, for like exquisite fruit in autumn, it produced the most precious flowers in spring. It was one day in this garden of our school, and laying eyeslessly upon a fruit tree, he mistreated and destroyed even the tender cocoons, sweet hope and promise of the future harvest. He even cut off some branches, and such a breakdown he made, that the owner of the garden complained to the teacher. And he came with a long drought of young ones, and the garden was filled with many more grapes, worse than the first. The pedant Domiine increased the evil needlessly by carrying that poorly educated chickens, with the purpose, he said, of making a skirmish that was exemplary, serving as an unforgettable lesson to all his students. He spread out on this subject, citing Virgil and Cicero, and claiming very scientific reasons. The parade was long, so long that the damn rally had time to devastate the garden everywhere. I hate long and inappropriate speeches. I don't know a creature more fearsome than the schoolboy, like the pedant. I wouldn't want to be a neighbor to either of us.
