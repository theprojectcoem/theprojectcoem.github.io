He hit his head and maybe he had time, a second, to thank for fainting, unconsciousness, forgetting the torments. The militia closed the door, hung the machine gun vertically from his left hand while with the other he was looking for a handkerchief to dry his face. He was young and had shown, until he was banned, a small mustache that he didn't want to grow up.
