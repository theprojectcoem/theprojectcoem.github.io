The man had his mother living in a distant village and did not want to stop saying goodbye to her for this reason. He asked the king to let him go away for a few days to visit his mother. The monarch only placed one condition, that a hostage should take his place while he was absent and, if he did not return, be executed by him. The insurgent turned to his best friend and asked him to take his place. The king gave seven days to execute the hostage if the condemned did not return. The days are past. On the sixth day the stand was raised and the execution of the hostage was announced for the morning of the following day. And the king asked the prisoners of the city how they were, and they said, O my lord! It's really quiet. He didn't for a moment doubt that his friend would return. The king smiled with skepticism. It came on the night of the sixth day. The hostage's peace and confidence were staggering. And when the king had made it to the morning, he looked in on the hostage; and the chief of the prison said, He has eaten a fine meal, and he has sung, and he is exceedingly calm. There's no doubt your friend will be back. - Poor poor! - exclaimed the monarch. The scheduled time for execution has come. It was beginning to dawn. The hostage was taken to the stable. He was relaxed and smiling. The monarch was surprised to see the hostage's soul strength. The executioner put the rope around his neck, but he was still smiling and serene. Just as the king was about to give the order for the execution, the horses' horns were heard. The insurgent had returned just in time. The king, excited, granted freedom to both men.
