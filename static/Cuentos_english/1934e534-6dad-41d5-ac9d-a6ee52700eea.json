Half an hour later, you leave with the same journal under the same arm. But it is no longer the same diary, now it is a bunch of printed sheets that the Lord leaves on a street corner. Just left alone in the bank, the pile of printed sheets turns into a diary, until a boy sees it, reads it, and leaves it as a pile of printed sheets. When it is just left in the bank, the pile of printed sheets turns into a diary, until an old lady finds it, reads it, and leaves it to turn into a pile of printed sheets. He then takes him home and on the way uses it to pack a half a kilo of apples, which is what the daily papers are for after these exciting metamorphoses.
