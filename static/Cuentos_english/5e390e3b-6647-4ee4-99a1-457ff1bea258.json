Here are also reports from His Majesty's ministers attesting to the merits of the invention. I'll give up the rights to her for a million tumtums. After examining the papers, the King took them aside and promised him an order for the Treasury Secretary of the Extortion Department for a million tumtums. \"And here\", said the ingenious patriot, taking another piece of paper out of another pocket, \"are the plans of a cannon I've invented that can pierce that armor. His Majesty's royal brother, the Emperor of Bang, is eager to acquire it, but my loyalty to His Majesty's throne and to His person compels me to offer it to His Majesty. The price is a million tumtums. After receiving the promise of another letter he put his hand in a pocket different from the previous two and remarked: \"The price of the irresistible cannon should have been much higher, Your Majesty, but the fact is that the missiles can be so effectively deflected by my new method of treating armor armour with... \"Check this man out\", he said, \"and tell me how many pockets he has. \"Forty-three, sir\", said the Great Factotum, completing his scrutiny. \"God bless His Majesty\", cried the ingenious patriot, terrified.
