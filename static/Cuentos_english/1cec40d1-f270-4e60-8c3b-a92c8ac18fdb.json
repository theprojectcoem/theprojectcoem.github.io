Trees spread thick cups over the grass. In rustic benches are some couples, their heads bent, their faces heavy and happy, their gazes lost at dusk. Not the words that whispered on the lips are heard, but they are guessed passionate and sweet, of which deep echoes are raised in the spirit. They put their spinning notes on the greenish sky, the color of Novalis' soul. The stars burn among the foliage. A child plays with his dog. From the waters rises fragrant freshness that smells the foreheads and extends our senses, penetrating them with its clear caress. The fireflies are shining in the lurch. Outside the picture a melancholy, dark-faced shadow under the pointed hat, wounded by loving pains, pocket-shaped and meditating on insoluble enigmas. The divine evening harmonizes their contentious concerns. FIN", "title": "Estampa", "author": "Julio Torri"}
