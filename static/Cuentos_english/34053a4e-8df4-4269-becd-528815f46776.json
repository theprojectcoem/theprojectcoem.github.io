But why? Because yes (oh, ineffable freedom!) And there they go, evil angels, looking for new adventures, a new home, a new cat, a new washing machine, a new lady who can't live without them and loves them; planning a new life, denying gratitude for the good treatment they received when they got sick and lovingly giving them their aspirin for fear that the next day they won't be able to wash the dishes, which is what really tires, making the food doesn't tire. I love to see them come, call, smile, enter, say yes; but no, always resisting to find their Mary Poppins-Lady who solves all their problems, those of their fathers, those of their younger and older brothers, among whom one raped them at his opportunity; who at night teaches them in bed to sing do-re-mi, do-re-mi until they fall asleep with the thought put sweetly on the morning dishes submerged in a new wave of foam of fab-sol-la-si detergent, and gently caresses their hair and turns away without making noise, of dots, and turns off the light at the last moment before leaving the room of vaguely irradiated contours.
