One day a wandering monk showed up. Whenever you raise a debate about Buddhism and beat the residents, any wandering monk can stay in a Zen temple. If he gets defeated, he has to leave. The older brother, tired that day after long hours of study, told the younger brother: \"Go and face the debate, in silence. So the young monk and the stranger went to the sanctuary and sat down. And it came to pass after a while that the traveler rose up, and went to his elder brother, and said, Thy younger brother hath overcome me. She's an admirable person. Tell me about the dialogue the mayor asked. I first raised a finger, which represented Buddha, the enlightened one. He raised two fingers, which meant Buddha and his teaching. I raised three fingers, representing Buddha, his teaching and his followers. Then he waved his fist closed in front of my face, indicating that the three of them came out of the same understanding. That's how you win. I have no right to stay here. After that, the traveler left. The younger brother came running: \"Where is that guy? He left because you beat him. I won't win anything... I'm gonna break his face! Tell me about the debate. The mayor asked. And behold, I saw nothing else, and he lifted up his finger, and cursed me for having one eye. As a stranger, I was courteous to him and raised two fingers, congratulating him for having two eyes. Then that bastard raised three fingers, suggesting that between the two of us we only had three eyes. So I got angry and I set out to hit him... but he ran out!
