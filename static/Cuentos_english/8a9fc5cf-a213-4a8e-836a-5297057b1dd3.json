His mother came up and saw him. \"Son, \" she said\", have you fallen asleep? Sleep well, and I'll go to the woods and get you a bunch of strawberries. I know you'll be happy about it when you wake up. In the forest, he found a place with the richest strawberries, but, leaning to pick them up, a snake jumped from the grass. He got scared, left the strawberries and ran. The serpent was hurled after her, but the Mother of God, as you can imagine, knew what she was doing and hid behind a hazelnut bush, remaining there until the serpent disappeared. Then he picked up the strawberries and, on his way home, said, \"Just as the hazelnut bush has been my refuge this time, so it will be in the future for other men\". That is why, since ancient times, a green branch of hazelnut has been the safest protection against hornets, snakes, and anything that creeps around the earth. \u266a Finish \u266a", "title": "La vara de avellano", "author": "Hermanos Grimm"}
