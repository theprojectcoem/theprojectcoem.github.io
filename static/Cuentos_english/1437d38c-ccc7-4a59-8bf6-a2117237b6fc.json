The man saw his elderly father coming in the distance and hurried to hide the dish so as not to have to give it to him, so that the visitor only drank a drink and turned back immediately. At that moment the son went to get the dish to put on the table, but the roast chicken had become a very large toad that jumped to his face, to which he stuck forever. When they tried to get him out of there, the horrible monster threw poisoned gazes at people as if he were about to throw himself at them, so no one dared to get near. The ungrateful son was condemned to feed the frog, for if he did not devour his head. So he spent the rest of his days wandering miserably through the land.
