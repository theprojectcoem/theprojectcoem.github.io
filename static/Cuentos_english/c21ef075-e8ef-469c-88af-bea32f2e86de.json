There the peasants cross the river in their boats, and work in distant fields with the little ax at their shoulder. The shepherds make their flocks pass through the mud to drive them to the reedpasts. From there they return at night to their homes, and the little island covered with grass is in the power of the whirling chacales. If you like, mother, when I was younger I wanted to be a sailor. They say that after the heights of the shore there are wonderful lagoons. In them, the flocks of wild goats gather after the rain, the juncos and the water birds deposit their eggs. There, the ants leave their pheromones in the soft and clean mud. There, the tall grasses invite the moonlight to linger in the lilac-scented air of their white flowers... If you like, mother, when I was a child I wanted to be a sailor. I will pass from one side to another, and the young men and the young women of the village, when they bathe, will look at me with astonishment. When the sun shall be high in the sky, when the morning shall come, when the noonday shall come, I shall run to you, wailing: -Mother, I am starving! When the day is over and the shadows are hidden under the trees, I will return home with the crow. I will never leave you to go to work in the city like my father. If you like, mother, when I was younger I wanted to be a sailor. FIN", "title": "La otra orilla", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
