He keeps an useless load of yute and has been there for a long time, oblivious. If Madhu lends me his boat, I would equip it with a hundred remembrances and put five, six or even seven veils on it. I would never bring it to the stock market. It would sail the seven oceans and the thirteen rivers of the land of the hares. But you, mother, do not have to cry to hide in the shadow of my absence. I will not go to the forest like Ramachandra, who took fourteen years to return. I will be the Prince of Hades and I will fill my boat with everything that annoys me. I will bring my friend Ashu with me, and so we will joyfully sail the seven oceans and the thirteen rivers of the land of the swans. We will go to the sea at dawn. By midday, when you are bathing in the pool, we will be already in the country of a fabulous king. We will cross the Tirpuni Strait and leave behind us the Tepantar Desert. When we return, it will be almost night and I will tell you all that we have seen. I will sail the seven oceans and the thirteen rivers of the land of the hives.
