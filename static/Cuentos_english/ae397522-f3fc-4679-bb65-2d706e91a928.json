She had nothing but the dress that covered her body and a piece of bread that had given her a charitable soul, but she was very good and pious. Since she was abandoned by all, she set out, trusting in God. A few steps away he found a poor man who told him. \"If you could give me something to eat, for I am so hungry! \" She gave him all her bread and said\", God help you. And he kept walking. And it came to pass after a while that he found a child weeping, and said, I am cold in my head; give me something to cover me. He took off his hat and gave it to her. A little further on he saw another who was half-frozen because he had no robe and gave him his own; another finally asked for his saya and gave it to him as well. She went into the woods at night and found another boy who asked for her shirt. The charitable girl thought to herself, \"The night is very dark, no one will see me, well I can give you my shirt. And he gave it to her, too. She had nothing left to give. But at the same moment the stars began to fall from the sky and when they reached the earth they became beautiful gold and silver coins, and although the shirt had been taken off, they found another entirely new one made of much finer cloth. He collected all the money and became rich for the rest of his life. FIN", "title": "El dinero llovido del cielo", "author": "Hermanos Grimm"}
