A certain courtier, who had long enjoyed the royal favor and, consequently, had become richer than any other subject, said to the monarch: \"Give me, I pray thee, thy wonderful mirror, that when I am far from thy august presence I may, nevertheless, render homage to thy visible shadow, bowing down day and night before the glory of thy benign countenance, whose divine splendor nothing surpasses, O Meridian Sun of the Universe! Praised for the speech, the king ordered the mirror to be taken to the courtesan's palace. But one day, when he went to visit him without notice, he found the mirror in a room full of garbage, covered in dust and webs. This infuriated him so much that he struck the mirror with his fist, breaking the glass and injuring himself cruelly. More enraged than ever by this misfortune, he ordered that the ungrateful courtier be thrown into prison, and that the mirror be repaired and taken to his own palace. And so it was. But when the king looked again in the mirror, he saw not his image, as before, but the figure of a crowned ass, which was the same as the artifact's authors and mere spectators had always seen, without daring to comment. After receiving this lesson of wisdom and charity, the king released the courtesan, had the mirror installed on the back of the throne, and reigned for many years with justice and humility. And when he died, as he slept sitting on the throne, the whole court saw in the mirror the bright figure of an angel, which remains there to this day.
