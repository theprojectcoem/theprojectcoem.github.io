They greeted each other and sat down by the calm waters and talked. Joy spoke of the beauty that reigns over the earth, of the daily charm of life in the forest and among the hills, and of the songs heard at dawn and at dusk. And sadness agreed with all that joy had said; for sadness knew the magic of the hour and the beauty of those things. And Sadness spoke eloquently when he referred to the fields and hills of May. Joy and Sorrow talked for a long time and agreed on everything they knew. At that moment two hunters were passing by the other shore. They looked over to the other side and one said, \"I wonder who these two people are. And the other one said, \"Did you say two?\" I only see one. The first hunter replied, \"But if there are two. And the second one says, \"I see there's only one, and the reflection of the lake is only one. \"No, there are two\", replied the first hunter. And the reflection above the calm waters shows two people. But the second one said, \"I only see one\". And the other one, \"I see two people, and very clearly.
