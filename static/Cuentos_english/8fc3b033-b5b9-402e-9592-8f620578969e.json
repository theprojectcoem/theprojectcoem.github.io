For each of them there are twenty weak and painful males. We live in constant flight. The females chase us, and we, for safety reasons, leave all food to their insatiable jaws. But the love season changes the order of things. They give off an irresistible scent. And we keep them excited to a certain death. Behind every scented female is a row of supplicating males.

When she's busy devouring it, she throws herself a new aspirant. And so on until the end. The union with the last survivor is consummated when the fatigued and relatively tired female barely has the strength to decapitate the rider's male, obsessed with his pleasure. She's been asleep for a long time triumphant in her field of erotic spoils. Then a thick egg cartridge hangs from the immediate tree. From there will be born again the multitude of victims, with their infallible stock of executioners. \u266a Fin's the Beast \u266a 1959", "title": "Insectiada", "author": "Juan Jos\u00e9 Arreola"}
