Still, I was always worried that someone would die. The winter was long, and the shepherd did nothing but beg the months: \"December, be favorable!\" Enero, don't kill my beasts with ice! February, if you behave well with me, I will always give you honours! The Monas heard the shepherd's pleas and, sensitive as they are to every act of homage, sent no rain or hail or cattle disease. The sheep and lambs kept grazing all winter and didn't even catch a cold. March also passed, which is the most difficult month of character; and it went well. It was the last day of the month, and the shepherd was no longer afraid of anything; now April, spring, was coming, and the flock was safe. He left his pleading tone and began to mock and brag. Oh, March! Oh, March! You who are the terror of the herds, who do you think you're afraid of? The lambs? Come on, March, I'm not scared anymore! It's spring, you can't hurt me anymore! You foolish March, you can go straight to where you know! On hearing the words of that ungrateful man, Marzo lost his temper. He ran furiously to his brother April's house and borrowed three days. April agreed, because she loved her brother. Then March picked up the winds, storms, and plagues that were running loose and then dumped them on the shepherd's flock. On the first day, all the sheep and lambs that were not very strong died. On the second day, he touched the lambs. On the third day, there was no animal left alive in the whole herd... and the shepherd had only eyes left to cry. FIN Italian name unknown", "title": "Marzo y el pastor", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
