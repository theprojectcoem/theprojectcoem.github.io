The villagers thought he was a remarkable and extravagant person. The truth is, that man was catching their attention while confusing them. The fact is, they asked him to preach to them. The man, who was always available to others, did not hesitate to accept. On the day set aside for the preaching work, however, he had the intuition that the attending attitude was not sincere and that they should be taught a lesson. The time for the talk came and all the villagers were ready to listen to the holy man confident of spending a good time at his shore. The master showed up to them. After a brief pause, he asked, \"Friends, do you know what I'm going to tell you? - No, they said. \"In that case\", he said, \"I'm not going to tell you anything. They're so ignorant I couldn't tell you anything worth telling you. As long as you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm not going to address you. The assistants, disoriented, went home. The next day they gathered and decided to reclaim the words of the saint again. He went to them without hesitation and asked, \"Do you know what I am going to tell you?\" - Yes, we know. - The villagers replied. \"So\", said the saint, \"I have nothing to say to you, for you know it already. Have a good night, my friends. The villagers felt mocked and experienced much indignation. They did not give up, of course, and summoned the holy man again. The saint looked at the attendants in silence and calm. Then he asked, \"You know, friends, what am I going to talk to you about? The villagers, not wanting to be caught again, had already agreed on the answer: \"Some we know and others we don't\". And the holy man said, Then let them that know pass on their knowledge to those that know not. After saying this, the holy man left again for the forest.
