He found a horse and took him to the country, telling him how much barley he had found, but that instead of eating it himself, he had better leave it because he liked to hear the sound of his teeth more when chewing it.

Never believe an evil person, even if he seems to act like a good person.", "title": "El lobo y el caballo", "author": "nan Esopo"}
