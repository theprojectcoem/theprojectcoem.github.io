The woman never gave him a look. One day the young man heard two customers talking about that woman in the store. They said that she lived alone, that she was very rich, and that she kept large sums of money in her house, apart from jewelry and dishes. One night the young man, armed with a cork and a deaf flashlight, sneaked into the woman's house. The woman woke up, began to scream and the young man saw himself in the painful need to kill her. He escaped without having been able to steal a pin, but with the comfort that the police would not discover the perpetrator of the crime. The next morning, as he entered the store, the police stopped him. Blazed by the incredible police wit, he confessed everything. Then she would find out that the woman kept a diary in which she had written that the young salesman from the corner store, a good-looking young man with green eyes, was her lover and that he would visit her that night.
