This has allowed me to corroborate the claim that travel is always more or less illusory, that there is nothing new under the sun, that everything is one and the same, etc., but also paradoxically, that any hopelessness to find surprises and new things is unfounded: indeed the world is inexhaustible. As proof of what I say, I will suffice to recall the pilgrim belief I found in Asia Minor, among a people of shepherds, who covered themselves with sheepskins and who are heirs to the ancient kingdom of the Magi. These people believe in dreams. \"As soon as you fell asleep, I was told, depending on what you did during the day, you're going to heaven or hell\". If anyone argues, \"I have never seen a man go to sleep, in my experience, they are thrown away until you wake up\", they would reply, \"The urge to believe nothing makes you forget your own nights, \"Who has not known pleasant dreams and dreadful dreams?\" Every one testifies that there is another life for the dreamer; but the dead have a different testimony: there they remain, turning to dust. Fin Tout le Mond. The first of these was the first of the two.", "title": "Teolog\u00eda", "author": "Elena Garro"}
