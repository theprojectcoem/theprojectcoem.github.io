They first selected the most important works in the history of thought. After a rigorous analysis, they were stripped of their accidents \u2014language, library, time, landscape, politics, anecdotes \u2014 to reduce them to essential visions of the world. Finally, with these fundamental nuclei of ideas they prepared the electronic brains. To enable the machines-philosophers to converse, they gave them the same language. Some of them \u2014 the mechanical philosophy ones \u2014 worked well, although nothing of what they said surprised the technicians. On the contrary, those that corresponded to philosophers they had described of machines, emitted estrafalaria combinations of symbols. The philosopher-machines for whom reality was a behaviour of consciousness only produced verbs. Others omitted verbs and instead encased or spelled out the adverbs. There were machines-philosophers who, with desperate neologisms, tried to re-establish the internal form of the national language from which someone had thought. There were even black languages whose words \u2014 if they were words \u2014 no one could identify. The technicians, overwhelmed by so many galaxies, sought a third code that \u2014as in Aristotle\u2019s argument about the \u201cthree humankinds\u201d\u2014would allow them to move from the computer code to the personal code. They found him. When translated, metaphors began to emerge. For example, to the question \u201cWhat is the universe?\u201d one code argued \u201can eye\u201d; another \u201ca thorn\u201d; another \u201ca soup.\u201d It wasn't serious. They had to dismantle the Academy and return the equipment to the War Ministry. FIN", "title": "Intelligentsia IX", "author": "Enrique Anderson Imbert"}
