In them I wrote, in large black letters, my name and the name of my people. I trust that someone will find them in a distant country, and then you will know who I am. I carry my yaks with shiuli flowers picked in our garden, and hope that these flowers, opened in the morning, will have the good fortune to arrive in the country of the night. After I have thrown my paper boats into the water, I look up into the sky and see the clouds preparing their white and comb-like sails. Maybe some friend plays with me from the heavens, throwing them into the wind, so that they compete with my boats... When night comes, I lay my head between my arms and dream that my paper boats bogan without stopping, ever farther, under the clear light of the stars of midnight. Dream girls travel in them, and carry their burdens of consequences. FIN", "title": "Los barcos de papel", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
