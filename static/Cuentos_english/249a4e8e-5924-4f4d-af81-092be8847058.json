To the insults Chano directed to him, the barber then responded with silence and the gesture of \"the words are carried away by the wind\". And there was nothing more... the barber went out at four to cut the paralytic's hair in the building across the street and Chano cut his way to shout more barbarism and hit him twice with the clawed foetot he kept in the car. The knife (did the barber take it out or did the blows loosen his muscles, unwrapping his hand?) He drew an equis along Chano's chest and belly. And in that same way he kept making jujuas, jujuas... until they took the unmade Chano away. FIN Spiks, 1956", "title": "Miniatura III", "author": "Pedro Juan Soto"}
