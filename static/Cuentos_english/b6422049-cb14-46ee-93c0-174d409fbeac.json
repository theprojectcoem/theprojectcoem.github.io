He called a thousand wise men from a thousand different tribes and sent them to his castle to write the laws. And they did their job. But when the thousand laws written upon the scroll were delivered to the king, and he read them, his soul wept bitterly, for he knew not that there were a thousand forms of crime in his kingdom. Then he called the scribe, and with a smile on his lips, he himself dictated his laws. And these were only seven. And the thousand wise men went away angry and returned to their tribes with the laws which they had written. And each tribe obeyed the laws of its wise men. That's why they have a thousand laws even today. It's a big country, but it has a thousand prisons and prisons are full of women and men, breaking a thousand laws. It's a great country, really, but that people are descended from a thousand lawmakers and one wise king. FIN", "title": "Las leyes", "author": "Gibr\u00e1n Jalil Gibr\u00e1n"}
