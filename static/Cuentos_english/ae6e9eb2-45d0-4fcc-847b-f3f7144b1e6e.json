The older one slept on a mulberry bed, the younger one on a leather bed. Early in the morning, the elder woke the youngster from his best dream, when he still did not want to rise. In meals, the older would give the younger what he would have preferred. If the younger wanted to drink, the older gave him water or milk, and when the younger sneaked a little rice liquor into his pocket, the older scolded him hard, in the presence of everyone. If the other person responded negatively, then he had to ask for forgiveness publicly. On mornings, I saw the elder chasing the young from a horse. One day I asked the master for his slave. \u201cBut he is not a slave,\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cHe\u2019s a champion and I\u2019m training him for his most important fight. He hired me to put it together. The slave I am.\u201d FIN", "title": "Contaba Mi-en-leh", "author": "Bertolt Brecht"}
