He interpreted it as a sign that he still had so many years to live. - What? \"I've got 22 years left to live!\" Do I have to be buried in the convent for that long? I will return to the world, consecrate myself to the profane life and enjoy its pleasures for twenty years. For the remaining two years, I will be penitential. But God, who hates the interpretation of signs, has devised their plan differently. And the two years which he had appointed for repentance, he let them pass on to the unclean life; but the twenty years which he had appointed for the unclean life, he cut them off, and put him to death.
