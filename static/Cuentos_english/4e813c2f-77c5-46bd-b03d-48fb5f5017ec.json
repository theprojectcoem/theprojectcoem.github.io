The teacher will say to me, \u2018Go, it\u2019s late, bring the sack and the books\u2019. And I will answer him, \u2018But have you not seen that I am older than my father? I don\u2019t need any more lessons\u2019. The teacher will be surprised and say, \u2018Yes, you can leave the books, if you want, because you are already a man\u2019. I will dress alone and go to the fair, where there are so many people. My father will run to me, saying, \u2018You will lose, little boy, let me accompany you\u2019. And I will reply, \u2018But you do not see, little one, that I am already older as a father? I want to go to the fair alone. And my grandfather will say, \u2018Yes, now he can go wherever he wants, he is a man\u2019. When my mother comes out of the bathroom she will see that I am giving money to my grandmother, because I am opening the box with the key. He will say, \u2018But what are you doing, unhappy man?\u2019 And I will reply, \u2018But you don\u2019t see, mother, that I am now older as a father and that I must pay my mother?\u2019 \u2018It is true,\u2019 my mother will think, \u2018you can give money to anyone you like, for he is a man.\u2019 My father will come home for the October vacation, and, believing me to be still a child, he will bring me out of the city hats and silk dresses. And I will say to him, 'Give them to my elder brother, Father, for I am already as great as you.' And the father will think, \u2018Yes, he can buy his own clothes himself, if he wants to, for he is already a man.\u2019 FIN", "title": "El hombrecito", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
