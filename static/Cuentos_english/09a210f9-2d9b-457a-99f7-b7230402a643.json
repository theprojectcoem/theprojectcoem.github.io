He sent a circular authorized by his royal seal to gather his vassals of all classes and categories. The circular announced that for a month the King would celebrate a full court, which was to begin with a large banquet followed by the mojigangas of Fagot\u00edn1. With these splendid features the monarch demonstrated his greatness to his subjects. He gave them a gift in his palace: what a palace! A real mulatar, whose tuff hit everybody in the nose. Cover them up, the Bear would never have done it! Notice the ademan, and the monarch, angry, sends to hell. The Monkey approved of that severity, and with low flattery praised the Prince's anger and claws, and the royal cave, and the stench he exhaled. There was no amber or flower that didn't look like garlic and onions next to it. Their foolish praise was no more successful; they were equally punished; it must have been that Lion relative of Caligula. It was Fox's turn, and his Majesty said, \"Do you smell anything?\" Tell me it with all frankness. What did the clever animal say? That he had a bad cold and couldn't say anything because he had lost his sense of smell. And he got out of a hurry. Take advantage of this lesson. In court, do not be rude flatters or unwise talkers; and if you see yourself in any difficulty, be Swedish. The following information is provided: Fagot\u00edn was a famous monkey in Paris.", "title": "La corte del Le\u00f3n", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
