The lost ship passed silently in front of the enchanted islands; the deaf crew imagined that temptation. The chained boss said he listened and resisted. He lied. A matter of prestige, a matter of legend awareness. Ulysses was his own PR agent. The sirens, that time, only that time, did not sing: the time that history recorded their singing. No one knows, because those scaffolding and algae mattresses didn't have chroniclers; they had other auditors, fetuses and corpses. Ulysses could pass safely, Ulysses only wished to star antagonising: always, the pulse of agony; never, the singing of the sirens that is only heard by those who no longer travel, no longer strive, have exhausted themselves, want to remain transfigured in one place that contains them all.
