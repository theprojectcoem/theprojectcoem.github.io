In his search he traveled the world, but there was always one obstacle. She had many princesses, but she never managed to be sure that they were true; she always found something that seemed suspicious. He returned home very sad, for he was determined to find an authentic princess. One afternoon a terrible storm swept over; the rays and the thunders were without interruption, and the cries of the birds were shrill; it was a terrible time. In these they called to the door of the city, and the old King came to open it. A princess was at the door; but, holy God, how the rain and the bad weather had spoiled her! Water dripped from her hair and clothes, dripped from her shoes, and dripped from her boots; but she said she was a true princess. \u201cWe shall soon know,\u201d thought the old Queen, and without a word she went into the bedroom, raised the bed and put a sheet on the metal sheet; then she piled twenty pillows on top of them, and on top of these, another twenty. The princess had to sleep in this bed. They asked him what he had done. - Oh, very bad! -exclaimed- I haven't slept with one eye open all night. God knows what I would have done in bed! It was so hard, I have a body full of heart! Horrible! Then they saw that she was a princess indeed, for though she had twenty beds and twenty stalls, she had sensed the guide. Nobody but a true princess could be so sensible. The prince took her for his wife, for he was convinced that he was to be married to a princess made and right; and the guide went into the museum, where he may still be seen, if no one has brought him. This is a story, right? FIN", "title": "La princesa del guisante", "author": "Hans Christian Andersen"}
