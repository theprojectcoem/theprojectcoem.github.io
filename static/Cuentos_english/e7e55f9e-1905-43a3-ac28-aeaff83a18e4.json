At first everything was going perfectly. But there came a time when the married brother began to wake up shocked every night, thinking, 'It's not fair. My brother is unmarried, and he hath half the harvest; but I have a wife and five children; and I will have all that I need in my old age. Who's gonna take care of my poor brother when he's old? He needs to save more for the future than he currently does, because his need is obviously greater than mine. Then he got up from the bed, went to his brother's place and put a sack of grain in his barn. His single brother also started waking up at night and saying to himself, 'This is unfair. My brother has a wife and five children and he takes half the harvest. But I don't have to keep anyone but myself. Is it right that my poor brother, who is more in need than I, should receive the same as I? And he rose up from the bed, and brought a sack of corn to his brother's barn. One day, they got out of bed at the same time and stumbled upon each other, each with a sack of grain on his back. Many years later, when they were both dead, the matter was made public.
