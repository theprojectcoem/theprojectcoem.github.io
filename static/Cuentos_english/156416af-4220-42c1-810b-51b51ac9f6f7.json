The years go by and the children come back. The three of them return the same day, brave and happy... the father is full of joy to see them again. \"To celebrate your return\", he says, \"I'm going to make a tortilla. - Leave him alone, Father, said the eldest. I'm the cook, I'll make the tortilla. You, Father, stand at the door of the house with a large plate in your hand. The young man pours the eggs in the pan... and the moment the tortilla is ready, he strikes the handle of his utensil. The tortilla is thrown up like a cr\u00eape, passes through the chimney duct and falls in front of the house, right on the father's plate. This one is amazed at his skill. And there's a gentleman walking by the road. And the man said, My horse has lost his rod; who can help me to put one on it? \"I\", replied the second son. I'm a weaver. Step back a little, please, and then throw your horse to the gallows in front of me. The gentleman, though surprised, obeyed. And the second son, fast as lightning, hears the horse in passing, without even stopping. The father is amazed again. Then a storm sets in. The hail is starting to fall. The youngest of the boys smiled, \"It's time to show them what I can do\", he said. He takes a stick, he goes ahead, he hits the screams so fast and so hard that none of them can get to the ground... and the father cries out of joy for having three sons who have become so skilled.
