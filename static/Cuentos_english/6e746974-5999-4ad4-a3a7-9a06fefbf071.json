And he gave the following reasons: the elephant combines wisdom and strength. His is not the pathetic ego that suffices to evade a good persecution or to obtain food, but the ego that has the strength to run large companies. Wherever this animal goes, it leaves a huge footprint. Besides, he has good character, knows how to understand a joke. He is a good friend, but he is also a good enemy. It is very big and very heavy, yet it is very fast. His tummy brings the smallest food to that huge body, even newborn babies. Their ears are adaptable: they only hear what they want to hear. It also reaches a very advanced age. He is social, and not just with the elephants. He is loved and feared everywhere. A certain comic wit makes him even loveable. It has a very tough skin; it is pierced by any knife, but by nature it is lovely. It can become sad. You can get irritated. She likes dancing. He dies in the size. She loves children and other small animals. It is grey and only calls attention by its mass. It is not edible. It is a good worker. It likes to drink and becomes happy. He does something for the art: He provides the marfil. FIN", "title": "El animal favorito del se\u00f1or K.", "author": "Bertolt Brecht"}
