A stream said, \"How did you get here, my friend, and how was your way?\" And the other one said, \"My journey was the most embarrassing. The wheel of the mill had broken and the farmer who drove me from the waterfall to his plants died. And I had to go down and chew and filter through the dirt of those who do nothing but sit and cook their laziness in the sun. And how was your journey, sister? \"My way was different\", replied the other stream. I came down from the hills among fragrant flowers and timid sauces; men and women drank from me with silver cups and children soaked their little pink pieces on my banks, and all was laughter around me, and sweet songs. What a pity your path hasn't been happy! And the river spoke with a mighty voice, saying, Come, come, we will go to the sea. Come, come, for in me they shall forget their wandering ways, their sadness, or their joy. Come on, you guys. And you and I will forget everything when we have reached the heart of our mother, the sea. FIN", "title": "El r\u00edo", "author": "Gibr\u00e1n Jalil Gibr\u00e1n"}
