The frog, in obedience to deviant mocking intentions, tied the mouse's leg to its own. And they marched first on the land to eat wheat, and then came near to the bank of the swamp. The frog, jumping, dragged the mouse to the bottom, as it rolled in the water, shouting its familiar cries. The miserable mouse, swollen with water, drowned, floating tied to the frog's leg.
