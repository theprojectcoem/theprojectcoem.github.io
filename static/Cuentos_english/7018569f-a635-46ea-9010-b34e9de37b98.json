A foolish teacher passed by, and the boy cried out, \"Help me! I am drowning!\" At this, the teacher turned and, unwise and unconcerned, began to preach to the boy: \"Look at him, wicked one! Where has his madness led him! You spend your hours looking after this kind of of offspring! Wretched parents, poor of them watching all the time for this unmanageable mob! How much they must suffer, and how I regret their fate! After all this talk, I get the kid out of the water. I censor here many more than you can imagine. Speakers and critics and pedants can be reflected in the preceding writing; each of them forms a numerous people; no doubt the Creator blessed that prolific caste. There is no subject on which you do not think of exercising your eloquence! You always have a criticism to make! But, friend, get me out of my hurry first, and then let your tongue out! Before pointing out the mistakes of others, it is best to first help them to improve their situation.", "title": "El maestro y el ni\u00f1o", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
