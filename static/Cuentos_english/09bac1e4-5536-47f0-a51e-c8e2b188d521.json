And I compelled them to go down to a well, where they drank their breadth. Satisfying the need, Fox said to the Goat: \"What shall we do, comrade? The difficulty was not to drink, but to get out of here. Lift up thy feet, and also thy horns, and uphold them against the wall; and I will go up first along thy thorn, and afterwards I will climb upon the horn, and come to the mouth of the pit. Once you're upstairs, I'll get you out. For my beards! \"The Goat said, 'That's a good thing you're doing, and I congratulate you on it. I never had such a happy idea. The fox came out of the well, left his comrade in it, and gave him a good sermon to settle down. If God had given thee the length of the length of the shoulder, thou wouldest not have gone into the pit of fools and fools. - Bye, then. I am already on my way. Go out as you can, for I have a business to attend to. In all things, you don't have to look at the entrance and exit. FIN", "title": "El Zorro y el Chivo", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
