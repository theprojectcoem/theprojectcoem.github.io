If I could grow up there, on a branch of this tree, and swayed by the sweet breeze of laughter and dance among the pretty leaves, would you recognize me, mother? You would call me: - Boy, where are you? And I would cry in silence without moving. I would open my arms and you would see me working. After your bath, with your hair still wet, dripping over your shoulders, you would walk under the shade of the fig tree to the little patio where you would say your prayers, and there you would smell the fragrance of the flower, but you would not know that it was from me. After lunch, when you would sit at the window reading the Ramayana and the shade of the tree would fall on your head and shoulders, I would project my flower-shimmering minuscule speck on the page of the book, exactly where you were reading. But, would you guess who is the little shadow of your child? At night, when you were out by the barn with the candle burning, I would soon fall to the ground, and, once again a child, I would ask you to tell me a story. And that would be what we would say: -Where have you gone, little one? - It's a secret, mother. FIN", "title": "La flor de champa", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
