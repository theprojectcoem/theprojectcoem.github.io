I was in my room after lunch when I was called from the office where my mother, sister, brother and two friends, one medical student and the other lieutenant engineer, were, who would answer for the truthfulness of the fact I'm going to mention. Let's go see. My brother asked me when he came in suddenly. What color is the letter A represented to you? What color? Yes; what color comes to your mind when you pronounce A? So... something clear... something white. What about the E? Yellow. What about the I? Red. When I said this, and I said it I don't know why with real certainty, they looked at each other in amazement. What about the U? He kept asking my brother. Blue... or purple. What about the O? Sorry, dark, something like that. \"You three brothers have assigned four vowels the same colors\", said the astonished student. In the O you answered brown, your black sister and your oiled brother. Is this a coincidence? One of them didn't answer my brother. So, discounting the O, which we've approached in tone, we've matched exactly four letters; and admitting that we could only choose between the seven colors of the spectrum, plus black and white, we had nine colors for each letter; in four letters, 36. Choosing all three of the same combination from 36 possible, is more than a coincidence. The relationship between the vocal and the color, is there? Is it the same for everyone? The matter is not new; but that is not why it is less unknown. Couldn't our writers and our physiologists tell us something about what they know and think about this?
