And Raboth said, The tree hath broken the leg of Raboth; there is nothing stronger than the tree. \"I am strong\", said the Tree, \"but the wind beats me and slices me. And Rabothiti said, The wind smiteth and slits the tree; the tree breaketh the leg of Rabothiti: there is nothing stronger than the wind. \"I am strong\", said the Wind, \"but where the wall rises, I cannot pass. Rabotithy said, The wall holds back the winds; the winds cut down the tree; the tree breaks the leg of Rabotithy; there is nothing stronger than the wall. \"I am strong\", said the Wall, \"but the mouse roars the cement and opens a drawing on it. Rabotity said, \"The mouse tears up the wall; the wall holds the winds; the wind slices the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; there is nothing stronger than the mouse. \"I'm strong\", said the Rat, \"but the cat eats me\". Rabotity said, \"The cat eats the mouse; the mouse scurries the wall; the wall holds the winds; the wind chops down the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; there is nothing stronger than the cat\". \"I am strong\", said the Cat, \"but the rope strangles me. Rabotity said, \"The rope strangles the cat; the cat eats the mouse; the mouse scurries the wall; the wall holds the winds; the wind chops the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; there is nothing stronger than the rope\". \"I'm strong\", said the Rope, \"but the knife cuts me off\". Rabotity said, \"The knife cuts the rope; the rope strangles the cat; the cat eats the mouse; the mouse scurries the wall; the wall holds the winds; the wind chops the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; there is nothing stronger than the knife. \"I am strong\", said the Knife, \"but the fire melts me. Rabotity said, \"Fire melts steel; steel cuts the rope; rope strangles the cat; the cat eats the mouse; the mouse scurries the wall; the wall holds the winds; the wind chops the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; there is nothing stronger than fire. \"I am strong\", said the Fire, \"but the water extinguishes me. Rabotity said, \"Water extinguishes fire; fire melts steel; steel cuts the rope; rope strangles the cat; the cat eats the mouse; the mouse scurries the wall; the wall holds the winds; the wind slices the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; nothing is stronger than water. \"I am strong\", said the Water, \"but the ships float over my back. Rabotity said, \"The ship floats on the water; the water extinguishes the fire; the fire melts the steel; the steel cuts the rope; the rope strangles the cat; the cat eats the mouse; the mouse scurries the wall; the wall holds the winds; the wind slices the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; there is nothing stronger than the ship. \"I am strong\", said the ship, \"but when I hit the rocks I stumble\". Rabotity said, \"The ship crashes against the rocks; the ship floats on the water; the water extinguishes the fire; the fire melts the steel; the steel cuts the rope; the rope strangles the cat; the cat eats the mouse; the mouse scrapes the wall; the wall holds the winds; the wind slices the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; there is nothing stronger than the rock. \"I am strong\", said the Rock, \"but the crab nested in me. Rabotity said, \"The crab nested in the rock; against the rock the ship crashes; the ship floats on the water; the water extinguishes the fire; the fire melts the steel; the steel cuts the rope; the rope strangles the cat; the cat eats the mouse; the mouse scrapes the wall; the wall contains the winds; the wind slices the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; there is nothing stronger than the crab. \"I am strong\", said the crab, \"but the man hunts me and tears my legs off. Rabotity said, \"Man hunts crab; crab nest in the rock; against the rock the ship crashes; the ship floats on water; the water extinguishes the fire; the fire melts the steel; the steel cuts the rope; the rope strangles the cat; the cat eats the mouse; the mouse scrapes the wall; the wall holds the winds; the wind slices the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; there is nothing stronger than man. \"I am strong\", said the Man; but Zanahary, the god of Madagascar, sends me death. Rabotity said: \"Zanahary sends death to man; man hunts crab; crab nest in the rock; ship crashes against the rock; ship floats in the water; water extinguishes fire; fire melts steel; steel cuts the rope; rope strangles the cat; cat eats the mouse; mouse scurries the wall; the wall contains the winds; wind slices the tree; the tree breaks Rabotity's leg; there is nothing more powerful and fierce than ZANAHARY.
