The lord is very afflicted because the eyeglasses are very expensive, but he discovers with amazement that by a miracle they have not broken. Now this man feels deeply grateful, and understands that what has happened is due to friendly advice, so he goes to an optician and then buys a double-protected leather case, in order to heal himself. A few hours later the cupboard falls on him, and he stumbles uninvited to discover that his spectacles have become dusty. It took this Lord a while to understand that the designs of Providence are inexhaustible, and that in fact the miracle has already taken place.
