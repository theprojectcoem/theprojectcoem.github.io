He couldn't speak. I was really shocked. The other three [the Blue, the Pecoso, the Black] who had entered when he opened the door, were quickly distributed throughout the apartment. \u2014If you stay quiet nothing will happen to you. The Flaco laughed, but Albert could not. \u2014Who is in the house? Alberto gave a brief reply. \u2014We, not you, boys \u2014can finally speak. \u2014How many? \u2014My brother Joaquin and I. \u2014How? You don't have a sister? \u2014 Yes, Miriam. \u2014She is too? \u2014 Yes. \u2014Why didn\u2019t you name her? Alberto cut his lower lip. \u2014Because it's paralyzed. The Flaco chose to keep the gun. \u2014How many years do you have? \u2014Doce. \u2014And your brother? \u2014Joaquin? Friday was nine. \u2014And your little sister? \u2014I think it's seventy. \u2014When do your old friends come back? \u2014Morning. And always leave them alone? \u2014Not always. Sometimes they have the sirvientas. \u2014And you, why don\u2019t you take them to Punta del Este? \u2014You may want to pass it quietly. \u2014You are very tragic you? \u2014A little. \u2014Do you like football? \u2014Clear. I'm a goler. And I want to play in National. \u2014He will look at you. \u2014And you? \u2014What? \u2014Is it National? \u2014It seems the nut has fallen off. \u2014A little. \u2014I am also from National. Better said, it was. \u2014Now it's from Penarol? \u2014No. Now I am no longer a Hind. \u2014What a pity, no? The Flaco shook an oregano. The boy put his hands in his pockets. \u2014In the bags not. \u2014I can\u2019t? The boy looked at him with astonishment. \u2014 Well, put them on if you want. But carry on. The others returned, accompanied by Joachim and Miriam. Black pushed the wheel chair. \u2014They say they don\u2019t know where the father keeps the collection. \u2014Ah, you don't know. \u2014They say the father has a collection, but they think he doesn\u2019t keep it here. The Flamingo looked at Miriam. \u2014You don\u2019t know anything either? \u2014No. \u2014However, I think you need to know something. \u2014No. Miriam seemed calm. Sometimes he moved his hands over the frazada that covered his inert legs, nothing more. \u2014Claro, as you are, you think we will have a l\u00e1stima. \u2014And you don't have me? \u2014I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a blessing. It is a sad way to live life. But at least you will live in a very comfortable apartment. There are some who can walk and yet it is much worse. \u2014Best if you don\u2019t have a laxative. I'm a victim of the l\u00e1stima, you know? \u2014 I imagine. I also imagine that you know where the collection is. \u2014You're wrong. At first, Joaquin cried a little, but now seemed fascinated by the visitors. Miriam had a decided look. \u2014Can the children go to sleep? \u2014If you want. But I don't think you'll sleep. He looked at Joaquin. \u2014Do you dream of you? \u2014No. \u2014Then what do you do? Best of all, they end up wandering around where the papa keeps his collection. \u2014I never saw it. \u2014But you know he has one. \u2014 Yes. \u2014How many pieces does the collection have? \u2014A lot, \u2014 Joaquin said. \u2014How do you know you\u2019re a lot if you\u2019ve never seen one? \u2014Because mommy always tells papa that it's dangerous now to have all those guns. \u2014And how much is a lot to you? And I know what I know. Like a thousand. \u2014And do you like them? \u2014I like the ones on TV. The Flaco began to review the huge library. He would take piles of ten or twenty books and see if there was any hidden, any key, any clue. Miriam followed silently his movements. The Flaco was awoken. \u2014Has your old father read all these books? \u2014I don't think so. \u2014And for what purpose? As decoration? \u2014 It can be. The Flaco made his point to the Rubio and the Pecoso, as entrusting them with another thorough inspection of the whole apartment. \u2014Black and I reach to watch this trio. Miriam looked at her hands. Alberto smiled. Now he seemed quiet, but his eyes were burning. \u2014You cold? \u2014A little. With a gesture almost imperceptible, the girl called the attention of the Flaco. \u2014Do you give my brother permission to go and look for a sweater? The Flaco was a beaten rat. Then he looked at the Black. \u2014Come with me, would you? She put her hand on his shoulder, and they went out. \u2014Can I sit? Joaquin asked. \u2014 Ufa. Yes, you can. The boy sat on a chair. The Fox faced Miriam again. And did the memory come back to you? \u2014No. \u2014We say if you come back, you will tell me where your old weapons are. \u2014I have the impression that I won\u2019t be coming back. The Flaco lit a cigarette and offered another to Miriam. \u2014Thank you, I can\u2019t smoke. Not only my legs are a pornography. My lungs are not first. Now the Flaco was recording the walls. He hit them with the twigs, as if he was looking for a point that would sound hollow. \u2014Do you agree with your old? \u2014In what? \u2014For example, in politics. \u2014Usually not. \u2014Why? \u2014I will not go into details about my differences with my father. \u2014You know your old man gives you very firm odiousness? \u2014I imagine so. And you would like to odio a little bit? \u2014No. \u2014Do you want it then? \u2014I told you I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to get into details. \u2014But sometimes it's good to get away with someone. We have all night, if you want. \u2014Decime vos qu\u00e9 sos? Soldier or analyst? \u2014Can't I be the two things? \u2014 Ah, caramba. \u2014Tay calm. I'm almost not the first, but I'm at least the second. \u2014Why are you almost not the first? \u2014Because I have no vocation. \u2014Why did you do it? \u2014We say that I consider it a duty. \u2014Just for that? \u2014Well, there are more things. But I'm not going to get into details either. \u2014 Touch\u00e9. \u2014I will at least say one thing: what do your old guns want? \u2014Just like books. \u2014Decoration? \u2014 More or less. The low tone of the two voices has ended by adoring Joaquin. Miriam passes her hand in front of her. \u2014You tired? \u2014A little. But I have a hose, don't worry. \u2014You really aren\u2019t going to tell me where the collection is? \u2014Buscala. I always thought that when you decided to carry out one of these operations, you would already have the full information. \u2014That's the ideal. But it is not always like that. We have to go with the collection, you understand? \u2014I understand. You gonna bite me? \u2014Do you really think I could hurt you? \u2014Why not? You get it when they grab you, don't you? \u2014Not the same. \u2014I know it's not the same. The Flaco seemed willing to follow that verbal trail. But she returned to Black with Alberto. \u2014Flaco, this is falling down. Can you sleep? \u2014If I don't authorize it, it's going to sleep, right? \u2014I mean, if you can sleep on your bed. \u2014 Better than sleeping here on the sofa. The other claudius. In any case, bring them cold. They returned the rogue and the scoundrel. They were not satisfied. \u2014What? \u2014 Nothing. \u2014 Did you review well? Did you review everything? \u2014Milimeter by millimeter. \u2014But you are sure to be here. \u2014Who knows? Doesn't it seem better to go? \u2014No, it doesn't seem so. We have time and safety to search. \u2014You'll see there's nothing here. No collection, no hat. Even a flaming eruption. Nothing. \u2014He will see that there is. I am sure. Miriam moved in her wheel chair. Maniobr\u00f3 until he was facing the Black. \u2014I'd have to go to the bathroom. You're taking me? \u2014Do you have it, Flaco? \u2014 Yes, of course. The Black pushed the chair up a corridor. He opened the door of the bathroom and brought Miriam in. He was about to shut the door again from the outside, when Miriam called to her with a gesture, and also with a gesture he told her to shut the door from the inside. \u2014What's going on? Do you feel bad? \u2014No. \u2014Then I left you alone. Or do you need help? \u2014No, I don't need help, but please wait. \u2014What do you want then? Miriam shook a little on the seat. They colored his fingers before he could respond. \u2014Decline to the Flaco to go to the kitchen. Right of the window. The third blue ray. *FIN* With and without nostalgia, 1977", "title": "La colecci\u00f3n", "author": "Mario Benedetti"}
