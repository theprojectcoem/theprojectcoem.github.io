That was the moment her son, Francisco, who was only six years old, had been waiting for, but he already had a penchant for medicine and surgery. Francis would take the hydrophilic cotton package, the bottle of denatured alcohol, the envelope of the sparrapods, go into the bathroom and sit on the stool to wait. - What's up? - asks Mr. Caesar, soaking his face. The other days of the week he shaved with the electric machine, but on Sunday he still used the soap and knives. Francis was twisting in the little seat, seriously, without answering. - So what? \"Well\", said Francis, \"you may cut yourself. Then I'll cure you. - Yes, said Mr. Caesar. \"But don't cut yourself on purpose like last Sunday\", Francis said severely, \"it's not okay by the way. - All right, said Mr. Caesar. But cutting without making a bet didn't make it. I tried to be wrong, but it's hard and almost impossible. I did everything I could to be distracted, but I couldn't. Finally, here or there, the court came and Francis could get into action. I dried the bloodline, disinfected, hit the spadrapo. So every Sunday, Mr. Caesar gave his son a bloodline, and Francis was convinced he could be of use to his distracted father.
