She, weeping and laughing, replied, tucking him against her chest: - You have been hidden in my heart, like an enchantment, my love: you have been in the dolls of my childhood games, and when, every morning, I made the image of my God with clay, you were there and you were gone; you have been on the altar, with the God of our home, and when I worshiped Him, you worshiped me; you have been in all my hopes and all my affections. You have lived in my life and in the life of my mother, you have been created, century after century, in the seno of the indestructible spirit that binds our house. When my adolescent heart opened its leaves, you floated around it like a fragrance; your sweet sweetness then bloomed in my young body as before the sun arose in the East. First love of heaven, brother of the light of the blue, you came down to the world in the river of life and finally you came into my heart... What mysterious fear I feel looking at you, son, that being of all people, you have made me. And what fear of losing you! So, well pressed against my chest! Oh! What magic has delivered the treasure of the world to my fragile hands? FIN", "title": "El principio", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
