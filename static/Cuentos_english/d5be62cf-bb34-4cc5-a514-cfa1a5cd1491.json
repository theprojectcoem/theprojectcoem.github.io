And he shall cover me with the crumbs of his riches, and I shall live in peace. For the king, as if he had come to see the poor man, hath made the chariot to stand beside him.

He took a grain of rice and gave it to the king, who thanked him and left immediately, carried by surprisingly fast horses.
