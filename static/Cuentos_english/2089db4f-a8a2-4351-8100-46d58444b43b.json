He spoke of justice and the struggle for justice, and of the workers who suffer, and of the constant work, and of those who are hungry, and of the rich, who have wide shoulders because of it. And when he looked at me, he saw tears in my eyes, and he laughed complacently, thinking he felt the hatred he felt and the compassion he said he felt. But I only heard it. What does it matter to me what men and what they suffer, or suppose to suffer? That they be as I am, and shall not suffer. All the evil in the world comes from one person valuing another, whether to do good or to do harm. Our soul and heaven and earth are hating us. Wanting more is losing them and being humiliated. What I was thinking while the man's friend was talking (and that had moved me to tears) was how the murmur of the crows, that evening, did not seem like the bells of a monastery where flowers and reeds and simple souls were ringing. Thank God, I am not good and have the natural egoism of flowers and rivers that follow their way unconcerned about knowing it so much as flowering and going on. It is this only mission in the world, this: to exist clearly and to know how to do it without thinking about it. The man had walked, and was looking at the setting sun. But what does the coming of the sun have to do with who hates and loves? FIN", "title": "Ante la puesta de sol", "author": "Fernando Pessoa"}
