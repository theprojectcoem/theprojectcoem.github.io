There were no bridges to cross the rivers. There were no roads to the mountains. You wanted one to sit down? Not even a bench, not even a shadow. Did you die in your sleep? There were no beds. No shoes, no boots to keep your feet from sticking. There were no glasses for the visually impaired. There were no balls to play a game; there were no pots or fire to cook the macaroni.
