I, with the best will in the world, cannot follow this \u201cBaila, dance, my doll!\u201d \u2013 But little Amalia did; she was only 3 years old, played with dolls and educated them to be as neat as your Malle. There came to the house a student who taught the brothers and spoke much with Amalita and her dolls, but in a very different way from all the others. The little girl found him very funny, and yet Aunt Malle thought he did not know how to deal with children; their heads would not take anything in his speeches in good order. But Amalita was so moved that she learned the whole song by heart and sang it to her three dolls, two of whom were new, one a seductress, the other a knight, while the third was old and called Lise. She also heard the song and participated in it. Dance, dance, doll, what a short skirt! And also the gentleman with his gloves and hat, white shoe and frac - tanned and very bright shoe. They are well done, my faith. Dance, my little doll. Here is Lisa, who is very old, although she does not look like it now, with the oil that they have given her, that is from last year. Like new and all. Dance with your partner, you will be three to dance. We are going to be very happy! Dance, dance, doll, foot out, so beautiful. Gives the first step, garbosa, always sexy and so funny. He jumps and leaps without stopping, how healthy it is to leap. Dance away delicious! We are a young group! And the dolls understood the song; Amalita also understood it, and the student, of course, understood it. He had made it, and said it was wonderful. Only your Aunt Malle didn't understand; it was too much for a child. - It's a party! - said. But Amalita is not a babe, and she sings. It is because of her that we know her.", "title": "\u00a1Baila, baila, mu\u00f1equita!", "author": "Hans Christian Andersen"}
