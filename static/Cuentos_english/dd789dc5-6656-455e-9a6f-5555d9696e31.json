Then I wondered which one I would have chosen and found that none of them was right for me. The young man in the glove, Titian, admirable in the painting, did not seem appropriate to me, for corresponding to a man whose gender of life I did not wish for me, for I intuited that in him physical activity prevailed excessively. The saints sinned the opposite defect: they were too sedentary. Godfather I found solemn. The faces of thinkers were unhealthy to me and those of boxers, unsubtle. The faces I really like are women's: to change them for mine, they're useless. After this preference inquiry, I resigned to the inherited face. Looking straight at me in the mirror, I found it acceptable, with something of a lioness that, while it did not guarantee an effective will or power, promised them in vague reserves. As for that promise, I've been disappointed. The years have infused a weakening in their eyes that has apparently liquefied them and made their light darker and sadder. The mimic, my natural nerve, drew wrinkles along the sides of the mouth in the form of arcs, or brackets, that transformed the young lion into an old dog. I never go to my profiles. I think the left expresses some hidden weakness of my spirit, which repels me. The other one's nose grows roughly and, I don't know why, it curves.
