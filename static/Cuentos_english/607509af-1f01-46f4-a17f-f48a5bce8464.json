He approached me simply, like those salesmen who walk us through the street. He asked for very little money for his map: he wanted to get rid of it at all costs. When he offered me a demonstration, I curiously accepted because it was Sunday and I had nothing to do.

I still keep it among dozens of similar deals and I have special affection for it because it was the first link in the chain. I'm sorry you don't have the stuff you sold and the coins you spent.
