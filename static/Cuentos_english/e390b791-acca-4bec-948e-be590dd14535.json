But there was a man, exceedingly poor, who was bitter with the prince and kept moving his tongue, pestilence in his censures. The prince knew. But he was patient. He finally decided to consider the case. And one winter night, a servant of the prince knocked at the man's door, carrying a sack of wheat flour, a pack of soap and a pack of sugar. \"The prince sends you these gifts as a souvenir\", said the servant. And the man rejoiced, for he believed the gifts were a tribute to the prince. And, in his pride, he went to the bishop and told him what the prince had done, adding, \"Don't you see how the prince wants my friendship? - But the bishop replied, \"Oh! What a wise prince and how little you understand. He speaks by symbols. The flour is for your empty stomach, the soap for your filthy skin, and the sugar to sweeten your bitter tongue. From that day onward, the man was ashamed even of himself, and his hatred of the prince grew stronger than ever. But the one I hated the most was the bishop who interpreted the prince's gift. However, since then he has kept quiet. FIN", "title": "Tres regalos", "author": "Gibr\u00e1n Jalil Gibr\u00e1n"}
