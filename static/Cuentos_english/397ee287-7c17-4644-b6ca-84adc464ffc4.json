The Gaviero stayed all night in painful vigil, waiting, fearing the collapse of his being, his shipwreck in the spinning waters of dementia. From these bitter hours of insomnia, Gaviero was left with a secret wound that sometimes carried the faint lump of a secret and unnamed fear. The alligator of the cockatoos that flocked across the pink extension of dawn, returned him to the world of his fellow men and put back into his hands the usual tools of man. Neither love, nor misery, nor hope, nor anger were the same for him after his terrifying vigil in the wet, nightly solitude of the jungle. FIN", "title": "Soledad", "author": "\u00c1lvaro Mutis"}
