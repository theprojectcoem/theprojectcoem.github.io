The wooden cottage is rotten due to constant dampness and odors. The small cottage on a twenty-meter plot next to three lines. There the guardaagujas lives with his wife, contemplating the trains loaded with fantasies that pass from city to city. Hundreds of trains, trains from the north to the south and trains from the south to the north. Every day, every week, every year. Millions of trains with millions of ghosts, making the bones of the mountain move. The woman, as a good woman, helps you to steer the trains on the right course. The responsibility of so many fulfilled lives has put a tragic smirk on their faces. Only if you can laugh when you stand suspended, looking at your little, a three-year-old creature, funny, delirious, with gestures of flower and bird. The trains pass with the smell of iron and long metals rustling from all over a city that is shedding its shackles, of so many disenchanted fantasies and ebbs of freedom. The daughter of the guardaagujas plays between the trains of her mountain with an astonishing confidence. He ignores that the rich children of the city are mending with small trains like rats on string. She has the biggest trains in the world... and she's already starting to look down on them. It's a doll charm. Live, unconcerned, slumber as if she did not want to be attached to anyone. It was said that a train had thrown her there by chance. Instead, their parents live in fear of her, contemplate her, while she is still a child, love her, adore her. They know that one day a train will kill her.
