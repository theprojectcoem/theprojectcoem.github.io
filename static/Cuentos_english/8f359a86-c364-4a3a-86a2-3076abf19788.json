He married a large and well-furnished, slightly raggedy, full of honorific ideas, arranged like walking trees. But the part she married was her part, which was called Mary. Olga remained single and took a lover who lived in adoration before her eyes. She could not understand why her husband was angry and reproaching her for infidelity. Mary was faithful. What did he have to do with Olga? She didn't understand that he didn't understand. Mary was doing her duty, Olga was adoring her lover. Was she guilty of having a double name and of the consequences that this can bring to you? So, when her husband took the torch, she opened her huge eyes, not terrified, but filled with astonishment, for she could not understand such an absurd gesture.

Olga continued to live in the arms of her lover, and I think she still is happy, very happy, feeling only a little frightened. FIN", "title": "Tragedia", "author": "Vicente Huidobro"}
