He had read the scriptures of all religions, followed numerous mystical paths, practiced many techniques of self-development, and listened to a good number of teachers; but he kept on searching. He left his country and moved to India. He traveled without rest. He went from one state to another, and from city to city, searching, seeking, longing to find. One day he came to a village and asked if there were any teachers to contact. He was told that there was no teacher, but that on a nearby mountain lived a hermit. The man went to the mountain with the purpose of finding the hermit. He started climbing up one of its slopes. Suddenly, he noticed that the hermit was descending down the same path he was going up. When they were about to cross over and he was about to ask him how best to speed up the process towards liberation, the hermit dropped a sack on the ground that he was wearing on his back. There was a deep, trembling, total and perfect silence. The hermit nailed his eyes, subtle and eloquent, to those of the seeker. What a look! Then the hermit took the sack back, carried it on his back and continued his march. Not a word, not a gesture, but what a look! The seeker, suddenly, understood deep within himself. It was not an intellectual understanding, but an immense and visceral one. FIN", "title": "El ermita\u00f1o y el buscador", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
