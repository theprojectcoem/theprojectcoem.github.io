The desire was sustained when she was going to spend her days on a farm: the altitude, the greenery of the trees, the rain, all that fueled her. When I heard Liszt, it was all shaking. She had been beautiful in her youth. And he got the desire when he smelled deeply of a rose. It happened to C\u00e1ndida Raposa that the desire for pleasure had not passed. He had the courage to go to the gynecologist. And he asked him, ashamed, with his head down, \"When is this going to happen?\" What's the matter, ma'am? This thing. What? The thing repeated.

But this is hell! It's life, Mrs. Raposo. So that's what life was about? That lack of shame? What do I do now? No one wants me anymore... the doctor looked at her with pity.

That same night she got help and loneliness was satisfied. I'm moving fireworks. Then she cried. I was embarrassed. From then on, I would use the same process. Always sad. That's life, Mrs. Raposo, that's life. Until the blessing of death. The death. He seemed to hear footsteps. The footsteps of her husband, Antenor Raposo.
