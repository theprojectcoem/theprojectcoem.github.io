One of the disciples ran to escape the rain and saw his master and said, \"How dare you escape the grace of God? Why do you not escape the liquid from heaven?\" You are a spiritual aspirant and as such you should be very aware that rain is a precious gift for all mankind. The disciple could not help but feel deeply ashamed. He started walking very slowly, shutting himself to the bone, until he finally got to his house. Because of the rain, he caught a persistent cold. The days have passed. One morning the disciple was sitting on the balcony of his house reading the Scriptures. He looked up for a moment and saw his guru running as far as his legs could, in order to get somewhere that would protect him from the rain. \"Teacher\", he said, \"why do you run away from the blessings of God? Aren't you the one who despises the gift of God? Aren't you running from the heavenly water? And the guru replied, \"Oh, you ignorant and foolish! Don't you have eyes to see that what I don't want is to desecrate it with my feet? FIN", "title": "El gur\u00fa falaz", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
