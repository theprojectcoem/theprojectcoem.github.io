And when she noticed that, besides the cold, it was raining on the trees, she couldn't believe she was given so much. And the world's agreement with what she didn't even know she needed like bread. It was raining, it was raining. The flaming fire winked at her and at him. He, the man, was dealing with what she didn't even appreciate; he was setting the fire, which was her birth duty. And she, who was always restless, doing things and experimenting, curious, she didn't remember to light the fire: it wasn't her role, because she had her man for it. Not being a virgin, the man had to fulfill his mission. All she did was instigate him, sometimes: \"That wood, it's not lit yet\". And he, just before she finished the sentence warning him, he had already noticed the wood, he was her man, he was already picking up the wood. She didn't give him orders, because she was the wife of a man who would lose his status if she gave him orders. His other hand, free, is within reach of her. She knows, and she doesn't take it. She wants his hand, she knows she wants it, and she doesn't take it. She has exactly what she needs: to be able to have. Oh, and to say that this is going to end, that by itself it can't last. No, she's not referring to the fire, she's referring to what she feels. What you feel never lasts, what you feel always ends, and it may never come back. It then incarnates itself over the moment, swallows the fire, and the sweet fire burns, burns, flame. Then she, knowing that it's all going to end, takes the man's free hand, and ties it to hers, she sweetly burns, burns, flame. FIN", "title": "Vida al natural", "author": "Clarice Lispector"}
