It turns out, at last, that the dreamed character was the real one. The explanation would be instinctive perception of truth. In the midst of a crowd imagine a man whose fate and life are in the hands of another, as if they were both in a desert. A man of strong will orders another, morally subject to him, to perform an act. The one who orders dies and the other, until the end of his days, keeps doing that act. A rich man leaves his house in his will to a poor couple. She moves in there; they find a shady servant whom the will forbids them to expel. The servant torments them; it is finally discovered that he is the man who has inherited the house. Two people are waiting in the street for an event and the appearance of the main actors. The event is already happening and they are the actors. A man writes a story and sees that it is unfolding against his own will; that the characters do not act as he intended; that unforeseen events occur and that a catastrophe approaches, which he tries in vain to avoid. This story could foreshadow his own destiny and one of the characters would be him. Fin 1868", "title": "Argumentos anotados por Nathaniel Hawthorne", "author": "Nathaniel Hawthorne"}
