A vigilance officer approaches and takes a blue-covered book. \u2014You don't know how to drive, do you? \u2014 the vigilante snarls. The newspaper looks at him for a moment, and then asks: \u2014You who are? The vigilante stomps hard, takes a look at his uniform as to make sure there is no mistake. \u2014Who am I? You don't see who I am? - I see a uniformed vigilance officer - explains the very distressed newspaper -. You are inside the uniform, but the uniform doesn't tell me who you are. The watchman raises his hand to strike him, but in one hand he has the watch and in the other the pen, so he does not strike him and goes ahead to copy the number of the watch. The newspaper is very upset and wishes it had not hit the wall, for now people will be asking him questions and he cannot answer them, for he does not know who is asking them and among strangers one cannot understand one another.
