If anyone comes to steal my grapes, the blind will hear him coming and the lame will see him. And if one of them shall steal, the lame shall not go far, and the blind shall be slain in the openings. One day the blind man asked the lame man, \"Where did this pleasant smell come from?\" Behind those gates, our master has very rich things. And why didn't you tell me? Don't you have that desire? I'm blind, but I have legs and I have strength to carry you. Take a bag and ride it over my shoulders. Show me the way, and we shall be content with our master's wealth. \"After a long time the owner of the vineyard came back. Seeing that the grapes had been stolen, he sent for the tenants. \"I put you on guard over my vineyards and you stole me\", he told the blind man. My lord, you see I am blind. I wish I could get there, but I can't. It was the lame, and not me who stole you. If you hadn't taken me, I would never have gotten there because I'm lame. And if you hadn't shown me the way, I would never have been able to get there. Then the man concluded, they both were stolen. As one man sinned: the blind is the soul, the lame is the body. And he commanded that the lame should be struck with a single stroke, for the punishment of the soul would be eternal. Russian Anonymous", "title": "Los guardianes", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
