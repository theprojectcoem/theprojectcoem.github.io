Once he had picked it up and loaded it, he felt so cold that before returning home he wanted to light a fire and warm himself up a little. He removed the snow, and underneath it, on the ground, he found a golden key. Thinking that where there was a key there must also be his lock, he kept digging in the ground and finally came across a small iron box. As long as you adjust the key! He thought. Surely there are valuable things stored here. He searched, and at first he found no hole in the lock; at last he discovered one, but so small that it was barely visible. He tried the key and it was indeed his. Turn it around and... now we're gonna have to wait until it's fully opened and the lid's lifted. Then we'll know what wonders the box contained. \u266a Finish \u266a", "title": "La llave de oro", "author": "Hermanos Grimm"}
