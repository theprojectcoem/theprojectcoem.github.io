The proof is that it is only given the opportunity to turn into ice or vapor, but neither of these satisfy; the vapor is lost in absurd divagations and the ice is rotten and rotten, is planted where it can and in general only serves to give vivacity to ping pong balls and gin and tonic. So water delicately chooses the snow, which it flies away in its most secret hope, that it will fix itself the forms of everything that is not water, houses, pastures, mountains, trees. I think we should help the snow in its repeated but ephemeral battle, and that to do that we would have to choose a snow-covered tree, a black spruce on whose unreachable branches the perfect white replica would be established. It is not easy, but if we had erected the trunk in advance of the avalanche so that the tree would stand on its own without knowing that it was dead, as the memorable mandarin was, it would suffice to wait for the snow to re-paint the tree in all its details and then to remove it to a side without the slightest scuff mark, in a light and perfect displacement. I do not think that gravity would dissipate the white castle of naipes, everything would happen as in a suspension of the vulgar and the routine; in an indefinite time, a tree of snow would support the realized dream of the water. Maybe a bird would swoop down and destroy it, or the first rays of the morning sun would push it into the abyss with a fingernail. These are experiences that I would have to try to make the water happy and to get it to fill our cups and bottles with that resounding joy that it is now only reserved for children and pigs.
