She answered, raising her eyebrows in a movement of complexity and doubt. What is pain? He repeated the creature, raising his little flute voice, with the pompous gesture of his pink mouth. Oh holy ignorance of passions! Why don't you nest forever in the loving cradle of the child's soul? The young mother left her work by the lamp, which lukewarmly lit the kind little group, and, taking the baby in her arms, inwardly, she spoke to him: \"Why do you ask me such a strange question, baby of my bowels? Who said that word next to you? And the mother, she would squeeze with her long, bare hands of jewels, nun's or honorable woman's hands, the fine little head. Mama, the neighbor told me, that old lady who usually brings you flowers for the Virgin. You'll see. First he asked me about you, with that voice that seems to be always crying. How's your little one, baby? Always this lonely?
