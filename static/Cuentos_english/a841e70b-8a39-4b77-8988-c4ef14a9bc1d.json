He loves the light of the sun, he likes to contemplate the face of his mother. He has not learned to hate the dust nor to desire the gold. Hold it against your heart and bless it. He came to this world of ten thousand crucified. Why, among the multitude, He chose you, why He came to your door, why He asked you the way, trembling in silence? He will follow you, talking and laughing without ever letting your heart recede. Keep your trust, guide him on the right path and bless him. Put your hands on his head and ask in your petitions that, while the waves are rising up threatening, the swell of heaven comes to swell its sails and push him towards the port of repose. Don\u2019t forget him in your rush, hold him in your heart and bless him. FIN", "title": "Bendici\u00f3n", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
