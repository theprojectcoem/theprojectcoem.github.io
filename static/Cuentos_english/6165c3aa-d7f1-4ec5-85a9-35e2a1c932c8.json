The Other Me used certain poetry in his gaze, fell in love with the actresses, lied cautiously, was excited at the evenings. The boy was very concerned about his other self and felt uncomfortable in front of his friends. On the other hand, the Other Self was melancholy, and because of this, Armando could not be as vulgar as he desired. One afternoon Armando came home tired from work, took off his shoes, slowly moved his hands from his feet and turned on the radio. On the radio was Mozart, but the boy was a bit spooked. When the Other Me woke up, he cried with regret. At first the boy did not know what to do, but then he reacted and deliberately insulted the Other Self. He said nothing, but the next morning he had suffocated. At first the death of the Other Me was a bitter blow to poor Armando, but he soon thought that it could now be entirely vulgar. That thought comforted him. It was only five days after his release that he went out on the street to show off his newfound and complete vulgarity. He saw his friends coming closer. That filled him with happiness and he immediately burst into laughter. However, when they came near him, they did not notice his presence. For the worst of bads, the boy was able to hear them commenting: \u00abPoor Armando. And I thought he looked so strong and healthy.\u201d The boy had no choice but to stop laughing and, at the same time, he felt a shiver at the top of his spine that was quite like nostalgia. But I could not feel true melancholy, for all melancholy had been taken away by the Other Me. FIN Death and Other Surprises, 1968", "title": "El Otro Yo", "author": "Mario Benedetti"}
