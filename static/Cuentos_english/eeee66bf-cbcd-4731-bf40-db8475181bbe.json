But perseverance won out and Raimundo learned to wash. Not to imitate liars, as they often do some slick or what you might think of them, but to really liar. What had prompted him to that reversal? He self-flagellated with humor in front of his friends: \u201cThe truth is that I\u2019m a liar for not crying.\u201d However, the most valuable reason was his almost Franciscan love for his brother dogs. Love is communication. How can you love then without communicating? For Raimundo it was a day of glory when his thievery was finally understood by Leo, his brother dog, and (something even more extraordinary) he understood Leo's thievery. From that day onwards, Raimundo and Leo sat, usually at night, under the stars and talked about general matters. Despite his love for the dog brothers, Raimundo never imagined that Leo would have such a clear view of the world. Finally, one afternoon he was tempted to ask him, in several drunken sobs: \u201cDime, Leo, with all your heart: what do you think of my way of drinking?\u201d Leo\u2019s response was quite stern and sincere: \u201cI would say you do a good job, but you\u2019ll have to improve. When you laugh, you still hear the human accent.\u201d FIN", "title": "El hombre que aprendi\u00f3 a ladrar", "author": "Mario Benedetti"}
