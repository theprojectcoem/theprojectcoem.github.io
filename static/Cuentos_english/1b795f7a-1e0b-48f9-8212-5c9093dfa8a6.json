And why do I have to fall? To rest. The mountain is steep, you're tired. No, not on the floor, on the beams. Why about the beams? Because the land is wet after the rain, you could catch a cold. Yeah, that's it, and now open your arms. Why? Because that's how you breathe better. And put your legs together. They held my hands by my wrists and my legs by my ankles; they pressed them against the wood. They took out a hammer and nails and started to nail. Why are you nailing me? So you don't fall when we put you straight. You could fall and hit yourself, or you could even hurt yourself or break an arm or a leg. And if we nail you, the nails will hold you. You won't fall. But what are you trying to get me to do? From here, from this mountain, the view is very good, but for you, from above, it will be even better. Because you'll be even higher. They lifted me up on the beams, the vertical beam was nailed to the ground and reinforced with stones. They said it's over. They were happy with their job. \"Well, we're going\", said the eldest, putting on the helmet that he had taken off, because he had sweated while working. And you'll stay here. And why do I have to stay here? To reflect on the meaning of suffering. I mean, so you can find out what it means at the bottom of the pain. When you find something, you'll explain it. But why do I have to find out something? What's the matter? Would you like to suffer for nothing? It's wrong, brother, it's wrong. It's got to make sense. They started to descend the mountain, moving away down. But who am I going to tell, I screamed, if you're not here anymore? They didn't answer, because they weren't there anymore.
