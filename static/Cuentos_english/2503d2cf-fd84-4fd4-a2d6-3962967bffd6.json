One day these assembled at an assembly and decided to send an embassy to him. \"Sir, \" they said\", why do you destroy animals like this, without sound or sound? You have to be patient. Every day we'll pick and send one of us to feed. And so it was. The lion, from then on, devoured one of those animals every day.

And she showed the lion her own image reflected in the water of the well. The lion Durdanta, the king of the mountain, puffed up with pride, could not control his rage and, wanting to crush his rival, rushed into the well, where he found death. Which proves that intelligence is more important than strength and that strength without intelligence is useless.
