To believe that whoever is conceived by his father is really, the more he has, to not believe that his mother would have brought him to the supposed father, that he thinks he never did. To have intellectual certainty that one person is the father of another, one would have to have attended the foundational act, have closely examined the fecundity \u2014 so as to have certainty \u2014 and even then, the idea of paternity would be metaphysically considered to encumber the matter even more. When an individual cannot assert that such a woman is his mother, who can assure that once a male has been conceived by her, he has not been changed by another conceived by the mother, for example and as hypothesis? The only thing we can say is that such a thing seems improbable or perhaps less likely than the opposite hypothesis. But absolute certainty is not there.
