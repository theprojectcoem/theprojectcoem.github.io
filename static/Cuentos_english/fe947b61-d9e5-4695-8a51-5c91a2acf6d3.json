To prevent others from discovering it, he buried it in the forest and covered it with leaves and branches. Soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and thought it all happened in a dream. He told it, like it was a dream, to everyone. Among the listeners was one who went to look for the hidden deer and found it. And he took him to his house, and said to his wife, A wood-worker dreamed, and saw a deer slain, and forgot where he had hidden it; and I found it. That man is a dreamer. - You must have dreamed you saw a woodcutter who had killed a deer. Do you really think there was a woodcutter? But since the deer is here, your dream must come true\", said the woman. \"Even if I found the deer in a dream\", replied the husband, \"why bother to find out which one of the two he dreamed of? That night the woodcutter returned to his house, still thinking of the deer, and he really dreamed, and in the dream he dreamed of the place where he had hidden the deer and also dreamed who had found it. At dawn he went to the other's house and found the deer. They both argued and went to a judge, to resolve the matter. And the judge said to the wood-carver, Thou hast indeed slain a deer, and thought it was a dream. Then you really dreamed it and you believed it was true. The other one found the deer and now he's fighting you, but his wife thinks he dreamed he'd found a deer that another had killed. Then no one killed the deer. But since the deer is here, it's best they give it away. The case reached the ears of the king of Cheng and the king of Cheng said, \"And that judge will not be dreaming that I will deliver a deer?
