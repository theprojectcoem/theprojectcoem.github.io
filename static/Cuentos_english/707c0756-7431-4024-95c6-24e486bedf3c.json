The locals, impressed by the holiness of the temple, had become generous customers. They were pleased to see that when they arrived at the tent, the four goldsmiths repeated the names of different Hindu deities. When a customer arrived, one of them exclaimed: Keshava, Keshava; a little later, another sang: Gopal, Gopal; then the third recited: Hari, Hari. Then the customers, very satisfied with such holiness, made a good purchase, while the fourth goldsmith said fervently: Hara, Hara. All these terms are names of deities from the Hindu pantheon, but goldsmiths were Bengali and in their language have a second meaning. Keshava means: Who are they, which is what the first goldsmith asks; Gopal means: A herd of cows, which is what the second replies; Hari is: Can I steal them?, which is what the third asks; Hara means: Yes, steal them, which is what the fourth declares.
