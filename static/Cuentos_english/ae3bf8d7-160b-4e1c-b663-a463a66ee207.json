At first he bought a mirror in which he looked for a long time in search of his longed-for authenticity. Sometimes he seemed to find her and sometimes not, depending on the mood of the day or hour, until he got tired of this and kept the mirror in a trunk. Finally, she thought that the only way to know her own worth was in people's opinion, and she began to comb and dress and undress (when she had no other resource) to see if others approved of her and recognized that she was a real frog. One day she noticed that what was most admired about her was her body, especially her legs, so she dedicated herself to squatting and jumping to get better and better hips, and she felt everyone applauding her. And so she kept pushing until, willing to do anything to get her to be considered a real frog, she let her hips rip out, and the others ate them, and she still managed to hear bitterly when they said what a good frog, she looked like chicken.
