Jealous of the fox for not being her chosen one, she saw a piece of food in a strain and took the monkey there, telling him that she had found a treasure worthy of kings, but that instead of taking it to take it to him, she had kept it for him personally to take it, since it was a royal prerogative. The monkey came up without further reflection, and it was pressed into the strain.

You never start a company unless you have thought about its possible successes or dangers.", "title": "La zorra y el mono coronado rey", "author": "nan Esopo"}
