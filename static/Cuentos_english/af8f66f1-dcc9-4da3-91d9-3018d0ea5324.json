But since he didn't know what to use it for, he dropped it in the mountains. A tiger, seeing such a strange creature, took it for a deity. He watched him hide in the forest, until he ventured to leave the jungle, always keeping a prudent distance. One day the donkey bowed for a long time and the tiger ran out in fear. But he turned and thought that, after all, that deity shouldn't be so terrible. Already used to the donkey's squeak, he went near it, but without risking the bill any more. When he had gained confidence, he began to take some liberties, grinding him, giving him some push, bothering him every moment, until the angry donkey kicked him. \"So this is what he knows how to do\", the tiger said. And he leaped upon the ass, and broke it and devoured it. Poor ass! He seemed powerful for his size, and fearsome for his peaches. If he hadn't shown all his talent with the cousin, the fierce tiger would never have dared to attack him. But with his kick the donkey signed his death sentence.
