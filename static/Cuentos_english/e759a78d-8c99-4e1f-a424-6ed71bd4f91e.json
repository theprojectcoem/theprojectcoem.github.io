But this doesn't contradict what I'm going to tell you: it's extraordinary and wonderful, and while it sounds like a fairy tale, it's pure truth. They knocked down a very old pine, the slumbering home of an owl, and the sinister bird that Atropos chose as interpreter and messenger. In its cavernous, time-eaten trunk, many mice, greasy, legless cubs, among other inhabitants, hid. The Owl had mutilated them with wheat and splints. That bird was running; you have to confess it. His partner had hunted the mice, and the first ones he caught escaped the lockdown. To prevent this, the scoundrel mutilated all those he caught afterwards, and depriving them of their legs, he could eat them comfortably, one today and another tomorrow. It was not possible to eat them all at once, and the stork would have been bad for him; his foresight was as exquisite as ours can be; he even went so far as to procure food for them to sustain them. Will the Cartesians, in view of this example, maintain that that Owl was nothing more than a clock and a machine? What mechanism could inspire the advice to so enclose the mice and make them unable to escape? If this isn't speaking, I don't understand what speech is. Look at his reasoning. When I catch these little animals, they run away. I must swallow them, then I will take them. Can I swallow them all? I can't. I can't. And shouldn't it be better to save some of the prey for tomorrow? There is no other way to feed them without them escaping. - What? Cutting off their feet.
