It is enough to look closely to discover that the line continues through the parquet floor, climbs the wall, enters a panel that reproduces a Boucher painting, draws the back of a woman reclining in a diva and finally escapes from the room through the ceiling and descends in the corridor of the parquets to the street. It is difficult to follow her because of the traffic, but with attention you will see her climbing up the wheel of the bus parked at the corner and that takes you to the port. There it plunges through the glass-bottomed nil of the reddest passenger, enters the hostile territory of the customs, climbs and slithers and zigzags up to the largest quay and there (but it is difficult to see, only the rats follow it to jump on board) it rises to the boat of rumbling turbines, it races through the planks of the first-class deck, it struggles to the top of the stairwell and in a cabin, where a sad man drinks cognac and hears the horn of departure, it rises through the seam of the jacket, through the sling bag, it slips to the foot and with a last effort it grips the palm of the right hand, which at that moment begins to close on the cock of a pistol.
