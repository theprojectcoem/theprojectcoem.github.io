And, admitted to the court, she danced before the prince to the sound of the lute and the flute and the citara. She danced the dance of flames, and the dance of swords and spears; she danced the dance of stars and the dance of space. And finally, the dance of flowers to the wind. Then he stood before the prince's throne and bent his body before him. And the prince asked her to come near, and said, Beautiful woman, daughter of grace and charm, how long has thy art been? And how come you master all the elements with your rhythms and songs? And the dancer bowed herself again to the prince, and said, Mighty and gracious, I know not the answer to thy questions. I know this only: the soul of the philosopher dwells in his head, the soul of the poet in his heart, but the soul of the dancer beats in all her body.
