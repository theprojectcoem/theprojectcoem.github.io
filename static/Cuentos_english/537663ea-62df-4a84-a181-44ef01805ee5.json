She would pass by there daily, but only on Sundays could I see her, for on weekdays she was in the office... But today I would see her and just thinking about it made me happy. Every man who loves knows that nothing is better than love... But it takes time and it's been an hour, two, three, four... See, it's going to be late! It was already a night of April that was trying to turn into another day of April, and without Raquel. I was ready to go, but love asked me to wait... and I waited. Until, finally! Listen for the corner. I scream, I scream, I twist the corner and I fall on my arms... from a lottery! : \"Oh, my God, I have only the thousand fifty-nine and four and tomorrow is the draw.\" Get to the appointment! Disillusionment! But, to do something, I bought the tenth and went home. On the next day, I had the great luck! Ah! Providence has presented itself to me! Of course, it had to be the Providence that, instead of that incompatibility of Rachel, sent me to the lottery in her place. Oh, God is good! I tried to fool you, my friends. There is something above love, and that is pasta. FIN", "title": "Incomparecencia", "author": "Fernando Pessoa"}
