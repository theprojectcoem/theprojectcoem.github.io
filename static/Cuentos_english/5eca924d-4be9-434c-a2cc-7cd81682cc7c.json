When the darkness will pass away and the light of the sun will shine, when you will stretch out your hand to your child, I will say to you, \u2018The child is gone.\u2019 I will, mother. I will become a faint breeze and you will be abrasive; when you bathe, I will be the little ripples of water and I will cover you constantly with kisses. When, on stormy nights, the rain will swell on the leaves, you will hear my murmurs from your bed, and soon, with the rejoicing, my laughter will pass through your window and spread in your stay. If you can\u2019t sleep until late, always thinking of your child, I will sing to you from the stars: \u2018Sleep, mother, sleep\u2019. I will slide along the rays of the moon until I reach your bed, and I will lay on your chest while you sleep. I will become a stumblingblock, and by the narrow way of your people I will descend to the deepest of your repose. You will wake up overstimulated and while you look around I will disappear in a moment, like a blimp. At the big Puja party, when the children of the neighbourhood come to play in our garden, I will become the music of the flutes and will throb in your heart all day. My aunt will come, laden with gifts, and ask you, \u2018Sister, where is the child?\u2019 And you, mother, will answer sweetly, \u2018He is in the little girls of my eyes, he is in my body, he is in my soul.\u2019 FIN", "title": "El fin", "author": "Rabindranath Tagore"}
