Everything had been arranged in such a way that each person sat down at the table according to his rank. The monarch had not yet arrived at the banquet, when a poorly dressed hermit appeared and was taken by all as a portionman. Without hesitating for a moment, the hermit sat down in the most important place. This unusual behavior outraged the prime minister, who asked him harshly: \"Are you a vizier?\" \"My rank is higher than that of visir\", replied the hermit. - Are you a prime minister? - My rank is higher than that of Prime Minister. Enraged, the prime minister asked, \"Are you the same king?\" - My rank is higher than the king's. - Are you God? - asked the Prime Minister scornfully. - My rank is higher than God's. Outside himself, the prime minister shouted: \"Nothing is greater than God!\" And the hermit said very calmly. - Now you know my identity. That nothing is me.
