A deer fell into the goat's bonds, and at the point he sent the goat to his partners. They all showed up and the Lion took the bills. \"We are four for the partition\", he said, tearing the deer in four pieces, and made parts, he took the first, as king and lord. There is no doubt, he said, that it must be for me, for my name is Leo. The second one also corresponds to me in law: you know what right, the right of the strongest. For being more courageous, I demand the third. And if any of you touch the fourth, you will die in my claws.
