To him it was not a matter of years or centuries, but of unlimited flows of time, and an ancient heaviness and pain in the arms that had become part of a scheme created by the gods and a piece of Eternity. If the gods had sent even a wind against him, this would have divided all the time in his memory into two equal fragments. So grey were the things where he was that if any brightness lingered among the dead, on the face of a queen like Cleopatra, her eyes could not perceive it. It was strange that the dead were now arriving in such numbers. They were coming in at thousands when they used to be at 50. It was neither Charon's obligation nor desire to consider the reason for these things in his gray soul. Charon leaned forward and cut. Then no one came for a while. It was not customary for the gods not to send anyone from Earth for that time span. But the gods know. Then a man came alone. And a little shadow sat shaking on a lonely beach and the big boat set sail. Just a passenger; the gods know. And a large, tired Charon rowed and rowed alongside the small, silent, trembling spirit. And the sound of the river was like a mighty sigh cast by affliction, at the beginning, among her sisters, and it could not die like the echoes of human pain that fade away in the earthly hills, but it was as ancient as time and pain in Charon's arms. Then, from the grey and quiet river, the boat materialized on the coast of Dis and the little shadow, still shaking, set foot on land, and Charon turned the boat to head fatiguedly to the world. Then the little shadow spoke, he had been a man. - I'm the last one. No one had ever made Charon smile before, no one had ever made him cry before. FIN", "title": "Caronte", "author": "Lord Dunsany"}
