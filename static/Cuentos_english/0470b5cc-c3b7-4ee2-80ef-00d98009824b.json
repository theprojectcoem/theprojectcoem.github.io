He ordered his chauffeur to drive him to that humble, remote neighborhood. But the neighborhood was so changed that Mr. Epididymus didn't recognize it. Instead of dirt streets, there were paved boulevards, and the miserable old houses had been replaced by apartment towers. When he turned a corner he saw the warehouse, the same old, shady warehouse where he had worked as a clerk when he was twelve. - Stop right here. - he told the driver. He got out of the car and entered the warehouse. Everything was preserved as it was in his childhood: the shelves, the outdated register, the weighing scale, and, around it, the silent siege of the merchandise. Mr. Epididymus sensed the same smell sixty years ago: a spicy and bitter smell of yellow soap, wet soap, vinegar, olives, acaroin. The memory of his childhood made him nostalgic. His eyes got wet. It seemed to him that he was going back in time. From the darkness of the background, the rude voice of the patron came to him: You fell asleep, as usual. Mr. Epididymus took the basket of marble, filled it with packs of sugar, herb and noodles, with jelly jars and lavender bottles, and went out to distribute. The night before it had rained and the dirt streets were turned into a praiseworthy one. FIN", "title": "Esquina peligrosa", "author": "Marco Denevi"}
