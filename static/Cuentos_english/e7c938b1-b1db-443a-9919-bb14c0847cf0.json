And the people said in their hearts, We know all this. Is he not with us, and do they follow us wherever we go? \" A few days later another man stood in the marketplace and began to say, \"There is no God\". And many of those who heard them rejoiced at their stories, for they feared the gods. And one day a man came up, very eloquent, and said, There is only one God. And all the people were astonished; for they feared in their hearts the judgment of one God rather than of many gods. At that time another man came and said to the people, There are three gods, and they are one in the wind; and they have a great and gracious mother, who is their companion and sister. Then all were comforted, for they secretly said, 'Three gods in one must disapprove of our faults, but also his gracious mother will surely be the advocate of our poor weaknesses. Even to this day in the city of Kilafis there are those who fight and argue among themselves about the existence of several gods and none, and about one god and three gods in one and about a certain blessed mother of the gods.
