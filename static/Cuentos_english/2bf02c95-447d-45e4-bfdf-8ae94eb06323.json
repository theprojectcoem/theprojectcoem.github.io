Do you want me to open the window? - No, I don't care what you say. The smell wouldn't go away, it's the walls that smell of onion, my hands smell of onion. The woman was the image of patience. - You want to wash your hands? - No, I don't want to, my heart smells like onion too. - Just relax. - I can't, it smells like onion. - Come on, try and get some sleep. - I couldn't, everything smells like onions. - Hey, you want a glass of milk? - I don't want a glass of milk. I'd like to die, nothing but die in a hurry, it smells more and more like onion. - Don't say such nonsense. - I say what I want! It smells like onion! The man started to cry. - It smells like onion! - Well, man, well, it smells like onion. - Of course it smells like onion! A plague! The woman opened the window. The man, with his eyes full of tears, began to scream. - Close the window! I don't want the smell of onion to go away! - As you wish. The woman closed the window. - Hey, I want water in a cup; in a glass, no. The woman went to the kitchen, to prepare a cup of water for her husband. The woman was washing the cup when she heard a hellish buzz, as if a man had suddenly broken both lungs. The body's beating against the patio tiles, the woman didn't hear it. Instead, he felt a pain in his chest, a cold, sharp pain like that of a punch with a very long needle. - Oh, my God! And the woman cried out through the open window; and there was no answer, for the bed was empty. Some neighbors peered out of the yard windows. - What's the matter? The woman couldn't talk. If I could have done it, I would have said, \"Nothing, it smelled like onion\". FIN", "title": "Olor a cebolla", "author": "Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela"}
