These men have lived confined in a cave, huddled against a fire, believing that the shadows they saw moving on the wall before them were the only things that existed. When they talked they did not agree on the name and meaning of each shadow. Of a sudden, not one, but all the cavemen come out of their chains, stand up, turn their heads, discover the fire, follow, rise, come to the sun. After a while someone shackles them and they are re-attached to the position they were in before. Now, the shadows, who know nothing, speak of the splendid reality they have just seen: they do not agree with their memories of light.
