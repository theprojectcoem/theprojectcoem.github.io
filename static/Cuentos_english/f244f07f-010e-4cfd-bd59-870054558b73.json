And there he finds the whore and says, \"Look, whore lady, I'm going to eat her\". And the fox said to him, \"But look at me, I'm very thin. I'm nothing but bones and skin. - No, that you were very fat last year. - Last year I was fat, but now I have to breastfeed my four foxes and I can barely find enough to create milk for them. - That I don't care! - said the wolf. He was about to bite her first, when the fox said to him, \"Stop, for God's sake, wolf master\". Look, I know where a gentleman lives who has a well full of cheese. And the fox and the wolf went to get the cheese. And they came to a house and they went over some carpets and they came to the well, and the moon was reflected in the water and it looked like cheese. And the fox came out, and turned and said to the wolf, Woe, wolf-friend, that the cheese is great! Look, you take it. And the wolf came out and saw the moon and thought it was a big cheese. But the suspicious wolf said to the whore, \"Well, whore friend, come on in for the cheese. And the fox got into one of the cubes and went through the cheese. And from below he was shouting to the wolf, \"Woe, wolf friend! How thick is the cheese! I can't take him! Come on, help me get him up. \"But I can't go in\", said the wolf. How am I supposed to get in? You go up there alone. - And the bitch said, \"But don't be clumsy. Put it in the other cube and you'll see how it goes in easily. And the bitch then got into the bucket she'd come down in. And the wolf got into the other bucket and, as it weighed more, it slipped down and the fox climbed up. And there the wolf stood looking for the cheese, and the fox went very happy to see her foxes. Spanish Anonymous", "title": "El lobo que cree que la Luna es queso", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
