Travel that travels you, he came to the country with the des ahead. - But what kind of country is this? - asked a citizen who was drinking the cool under a tree. The citizen, for all the answers, pulled out a knife from his pocket and showed it openly on his palm. - See this? - It's a knife. - You're wrong. This is a desnavaja, that is, a knife with the des in front. It's used to grow pens when they're worn out, and it's very useful in schools. - Great, said Juanito. What else? - Then we have the \"despercher\". - You mean the drill bit. - A peach doesn't do much good if you don't have a coat to hang on. With our \"despercher\" everything is different. You don't have to hang anything, it's all hanging. If you need a coat, go there and untie it. The person who needs a jacket doesn't have to go and buy it. He goes to the wake and unlocks it. There's the summer and winter sunrise, the men's and women's sunrise. That's how we save a lot of money. - A real wonder. What else? - Then we have the \"describing machine\", which instead of taking pictures, makes caricatures, and we laugh. Then we have the \"descanon\". - Brrrrr, what a scare! - What's up? The canon is the opposite of the cannon, and it serves to undo war. - How does it work? - It's very simple; even a child can handle it. If there's a war, we blow the horn, we fire the cannon and the war is quickly dismantled. - What a wonderful country with the \"des\" in front of it.
