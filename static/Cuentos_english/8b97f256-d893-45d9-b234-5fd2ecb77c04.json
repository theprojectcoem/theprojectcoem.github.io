I didn't know who they were burying, but what mattered? We humans are all one big family. Besides, you can always ask. My neighbor on the left of the courtyard didn't know either. I'm going to the laundry to pick up a pair of pants. I've seen the funeral and since I'm on my way, I've joined. Just to the corner and then twist. I asked the neighbor on the right. Who's funeral is it? And what do I know, do few people die? The bank doesn't open until nine, so I have a little time yet. The third, walking a few steps back, was also unable to inform me. I'm not from here, I'm just a tourist. But ask that lady in the black veil, the one who walks behind the coffin. She looks like the widow, and she must know it. At that moment it started to rain and I abandoned the courtship. I'm not gonna get wet on someone I don't even know personally. FIN", "title": "El funeral", "author": "Slawomir Mrozek"}
