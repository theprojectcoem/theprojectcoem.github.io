I had no faith except in hydraulic lime and reinforced concrete. For him, behind all satisfaction came something dark and painful, which were primarily bills. - See that girl who married the gunman? - he asked me a long time ago with an air of deep compassion. - I know. - What a miserable man! Now a lot of joy, huh, and travel, but then the bills will come. Olaberri was worried about bills. For Olaberri, who was a small contractor, bills were like the shadow of Banquo, who appears at the banquet of life. If Olaberri had the statistical sense of our late friend Berecoche, he would say that there are 75 percent of bills in life. \"I have already told the priest\", he told me once, \"you, with a bucket of water and a cloth, already have for the whole year, and to live well; we, on the other hand, poor contractors, always running around with the bills. Olaberri had macabre tastes. He had built several graves in the cemetery and moved corpses and bones and some newly dead bodies. In describing these movements, I felt, no doubt, an explanatory ardor of a medieval and macabre artist. The bones, the earth-filled skulls, the pieces of clothing or clothing, the rotten wood of the coffins, all gave a boost to his picturesque talk. When he related the transfer of a newly buried body, he looked good; then the realistic details were so terrible that any simple person would get his hair cut. They came out to glow with white busans and green gurgles, and at the last people didn't know whether to tremble or laugh. He had no disgust for anything. \"The best snails ever eaten\", I used to say, \"are picked up in the grave of the late pastor\". I've never eaten them better.
