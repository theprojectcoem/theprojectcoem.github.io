When someone translated one of his poems into another language (at least one he knew), his own words sounded better than they did in the original. It was therefore no surprise to him that the French version of his poem \"The Time and the Bell\" seemed to him splendid, difficult, strong. Two years later, an Italian translator, who knew no English, translated that French version, and although he had never been a fan of the indirect versions (he did not forget, however, that many years earlier he had known through them Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and also Confucius), he greatly enjoyed his poem in Italian form. It took another three years and an English translator, who, like most English translators, knew no Spanish, based his version on the Italian version, which was based on the French version. Despite its remote origin, it was the greatest pleasure to the first Hispano-American author. It was only a little surprising (in fact, attributed to a number of errors) that this new indirect version was titled Burnt Norton and that the presumed author's name was such T. S. Eliot. However, he liked it so much that he decided to take charge of translating it into Spanish himself. FIN", "title": "Traducciones", "author": "Mario Benedetti"}
