He brought down from heaven a king so peaceful, he could not be more. But it produced such a roar as it fell, that those amphibious, fearful and frightening people ran underwater, among reeds and reeds, into the bottom and hiding places of the pond, without daring for long to look the face of the one they judged a terrible giant. The giant was nothing more than a pole, which frightened the first frog that dared to get out of its pit; but soon he came near, still trembling, and as another followed her, and another after, a herd of those timid little animals gathered, and losing fear, they finally familiarly jumped over the feared monarch. His majesty consented without giving signs of life; and at the same moment Jupiter began to hear new cries. - Give us, said the people of the pond, a real king. And the king of the gods sent a ravenous cranel to them, which at once began to trap and swallow subjects at his pleasure. What a pity then for the frogs! But Jupiter said to them, \"Enough of the speed. Am I to be on your whim? They were to keep their first government; and in case of a move, they were to be content that their king was peaceful and meek. Now, if you do not want that one, you must put up with him, lest he send another worse than him. FIN", "title": "Las ranas pidiendo rey", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
