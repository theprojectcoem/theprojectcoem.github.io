One day, the evil demon, Potanka, was redeemed. The ermitaan came out and asked him where they were going every day. \u2014We are going to the king's house to eat. Their cooks prepare everything without sulphur, which we like very much! As the king's house brought him food every day, he wrote on the empty plates what the devils would eat at the king's table. When this man read what the ermitao had written, he replaced all the cretins he had in the kitchen by devotees who, when beginning any task, said, \u2014May God bless us! Soon the erminist saw the devils again: they had marched into the palace cheerful and happy, but they had returned sad and disappointed. He asked Potanka why they had returned so soon. \u2014You have your mouth shut! We will pay you now! After that encounter, the ermite gave up seeing the devils. One day a beautiful woman came to his house, and he asked her who she was and where she came from. They talked, they drank wine, they got drunk and they decided to get married. They went to the church, and everything was already arranged. God begins the ceremony. When they were about to put the crowns on them, the erminol was saved. The devils fled, and he saw before him a stag that was ready to save him. After that, it was prayed for another thirty-three years.
