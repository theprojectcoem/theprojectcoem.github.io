He called Satan and sent him to the bottom of the sea to pick up a handful of land and bring it to him. \"Well\", thought Satan, \"I will make a land like it, and for myself!\" He went into the water, took the ground in one hand, and also filled his mouth with soil. He went up and gave him up to God, and he could not say a word. Everywhere God cast the earth, there was a surface so flat that if one were to set at one end, he could see everything in the other. Satan saw it, wanted to say something and he choked. God asked him what he wanted. Satan began to cough and run away, and he was so afraid that he was seized. He fled, being chased by thunder and lightning, which struck him. And where it fell, sticks and hills rose. Where I coughed, there was a mountain growing. And wherever he jumped, he was climbing to the sky with the peaks of the very high mountains. And he went through the earth, and covered it all, and covered it with hills, and hills, and mountains, and high peaks.
