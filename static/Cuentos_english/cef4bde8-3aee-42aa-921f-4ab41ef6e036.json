Taking advantage of the occasion, he accused the wolf of the fox, expressing the following: \"She has no respect for our highness, and so she has not even come near to greet or ask about her health. At that very moment the fox came, just in time to hear what the wolf said. And the lion, being angry at her, cried out fiercely against the whore; but she asked for the word to justify herself, and said, Tell me, of all the visitors that you have here, who hath rendered you such special service as I have done, that I have sought everywhere doctors who with their wisdom will prescribe an ideal remedy for you, finding it at last? \"And what is that remedy?\" the lion ordered. \"You must sacrifice a wolf and put on its skin as a coat\", replied the fox. At once the wolf was condemned to death, and the fox, laughing, exclaimed: \"The boss must not be brought to enmity, but to benevolence\". Whoever sets traps for the innocent is the first to fall into them.", "title": "El le\u00f3n, la zorra y el lobo", "author": "nan Esopo"}
