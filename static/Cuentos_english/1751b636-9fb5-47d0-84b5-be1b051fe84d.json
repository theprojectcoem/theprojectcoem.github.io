And the mother of God came by the way, and saw the affliction of the poor man, and said to him, I am tired and thirsty; give me a glass of wine, and I will help thee to draw out the chariot. \"I'm glad to hear that\", replied the driver, \"but I don't have a glass to pour wine in. The Mother of God then broke a white flower with white stripes, called a correhuela, which has a glass-like shape. And he gave it to the chariot-driver, and he filled it with wine, and the mother of God drank it; and the chariot came out of the stubble, and the chariot-driver went on his way. Since then, the flower has been called the \"waste of the mother of God\". FIN", "title": "El vasito de la madre de Dios", "author": "Hermanos Grimm"}
