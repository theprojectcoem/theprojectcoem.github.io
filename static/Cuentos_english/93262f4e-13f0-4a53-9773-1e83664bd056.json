One of the men said to the other, \"How have you won your bet?\" The priest looked at him in silence and, in the guise of conclusion, took a drink of beer. The older woman said, hesitantly and observantly, \"You have lost weight.\" The man who had cried a second time, cried again this time. And he also this time interrogated the man who had begun the dialogue and who had now closed it with these words: \u2014Yes, he has lost weight. This dialogue seemed to me as important and dense as any other. FIN", "title": "Un breve di\u00e1logo", "author": "Bertolt Brecht"}
