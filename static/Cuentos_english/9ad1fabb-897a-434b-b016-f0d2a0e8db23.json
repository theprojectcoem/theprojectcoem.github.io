So it's best to stay in bed, away from the world's calls. There's still the phone, on the light desk, which sometimes rings interrupting their hugs: it's the relatives calling to see if everything's okay. But these familiar phone calls are also becoming increasingly rare and laconic. Lovers get up just to go to the bathroom, and not always; the bed is all messed up, the sheets worn out, but they don't realize it, each immersed in the blue wave of each other's eyes, their limbs mystically entwined. The first week they ate cookies, which they had provided in abundance. Since the cookies are over, they're eaten together now. Anesthetised by desire, they tear off large pieces of flesh with their teeth, between two kisses they devour their nose or little finger, drink each other's blood; then, satiated, they make love again, as they can, and fall asleep to start again when they wake up. They've lost count of days and hours. They're not pretty to look at, that's true, bloody, dismembered, sticky, but their love goes beyond conventions.
