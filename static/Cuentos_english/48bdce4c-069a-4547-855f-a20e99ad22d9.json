Both of them loved him very much and each of them wished the man to be like them. And the man's hair began to grow red, which the young woman did not like, for it made him too old for her. So every night I used to comb him and use it to pull out all the white hair I could see. The old woman, for her part, was pleased to see her husband's hair grow curly, as she did not like being treated like her mother. So every night, with the excuse of fixing his hair, he would pull out every black hair he saw. The result of all this was that in a short time this man was left with a head that was crooked and lily. If you want to please everyone, you won't please anyone.", "title": "El hombre que ten\u00eda dos esposas", "author": "nan Esopo"}
