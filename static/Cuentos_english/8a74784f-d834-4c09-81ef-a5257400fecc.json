He had committed a crime long ago, and worse still, he had no money left. Of the two human races, he belonged to the one who borrowed. He was a matchless fatuo who found nothing in Darius but an admirable virtuoso of words, and in Lugones a brilliant imitator without true originality. His life was completely irregular. Notorious for his bad manners, no one will be surprised that we deliberately forgot him when we drafted the list of Ariel Group members. His illustration was very uneven, and certainly not academic. He did not know the rudiments of Latin, did not read the English humorists of the time of Queen Anne, did not own the princely edition of the tales of Lafontaine, which adorned Eisen and Chauffard, nor had he heard of the Pseudo Calisthenes, the Pseudo Turpinus, or the Pseudo Pamphilus. But despite everything, and out of a strange whim of fortune, he did better than us. There is no doubt that poetry gifts are distributed arbitrarily and sometimes bring luck to the worst subjects (of which so many illustrative examples can be cited). You're often admired for even idolatry of a poet we used to say at our friendly dinners of the Ariel Group, and not want it for a companion in paradise. After we had given ourselves intolerable rhyming puzzles, we consoled ourselves by considering that while poetry has curious virtues such as moving trees and stopping the flow of rivers, it does not alone dignify its cultivators or give them authority in letters.
