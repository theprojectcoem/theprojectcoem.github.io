They started walking and on a big street they saw a brothel that was facing each other with a shrine. One of the friends decided to spend a few hours in the brothel, drinking and enjoying the beautiful prostitutes, while the other chose to spend that time in the sanctuary, listening to a teacher talk about inner conquest. A few minutes passed, and then the friend who was at the brothel began to lament not being listening to the teacher at the shrine, while the other friend, on the contrary, instead of being attentive to the teachings he was hearing, was dreaming of the brothel and reproaching himself how foolish he had been for not choosing the fun. And the man that was in the brothel gained the same merits as if he had been in the sanctuary; and he that was in the sanctuary gathered as many merits as if he had been in the brothel.
