On one occasion, flying from flower to flower and drunk with nectar, she went recklessly away from her hive more than advisable, and when she realized it had already been done at night. Just as the sun was setting, she was delighting in the sweet nectar of a lotus. As darkness fell, the lotus folded over itself and closed, trapping the bee inside. She said to herself, \"It doesn't matter. I'll be here all night and I'll never stop licking this wonderful nectar. Tomorrow, as soon as it's morning, I'll go and get my family and friends to come and taste this delicious food. I'm sure it will make them very happy. The night fell completely. A huge, hungry elephant passed by the place and swallowed everything that was in its path. The bee, ignorant of everything that happened outside and comfortably lodged inside the lotus, continued to lick. Then he said, \"What a wonderful nectar, sweet, delicious! This is wonderful! Not only will I bring all my family, friends and neighbors here to try it, but I will devote myself to making honey and I can sell it and get a lot of money for it and buy all the things I like in the world. Suddenly, the ground beside him trembled. The elephant swallowed the lotus and the bee barely had time to think: I'm dying to die.
