Serving as a mantle for a Turkish tapestry, it's very easy to understand the gifted life of the two friends. But at the best moment something spoiled the feast: At the door of the room they suddenly heard a noise and saw that the cat came out. He fled the court mouse, followed by his partner who didn't know where to hide. The noise stopped; the cat left with the maid and the mice returned to the cargo. And the palace mouse said, \"Let's finish the feast. - No, I'm not. \"Enough\", replied the peasant. Come to my cave tomorrow, that although I cannot give me king's feasts, no one interrupts me, and we can eat peacefully. Bye, cousin! What is the value of pleasure when fear is bitter! You don't want to live surrounded by wealth, if they're going to be the cause of your misery. FIN", "title": "El rat\u00f3n de la corte y el rat\u00f3n campesino", "author": "Jean de La Fontaine"}
