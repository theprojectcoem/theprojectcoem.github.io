In his face, all the misery; in his heart, all the shame. Not a thought crossed his brain; he had only a desire to end, to rest forever his sick bones. Perhaps he would have preferred to die in that filthy hospital where the debris of vice was being built, than to come back to life. He was carrying a scarf with his poor clothes, a few rags to adorn himself with. His eyes, accustomed to the semi-darkness, were troubled by daylight. The bitter sun shone inexorably in the blue sky. Suddenly, the woman found herself surrounded by people, and she stopped to watch the procession passing by the street. I hadn't seen her in so long! Back in the village, when I was young and happy and not despised! But it was so far away!

In his face, all the misery; in his heart, all the shame. Suddenly the woman felt in her soul an infinite sweetness, and she turned and was dazzled, and then she saw a majestic white shadow following her and carrying out her chest her wounded and pierced heart by thorns. And the majestic white shadow, with the bright gaze and the smile full of irony, looked upon the priests, the warriors, the magnates, all the great men of the earth, and, turning away from them, and approaching the sad woman, kissed her, with a very pure kiss, on her forehead. \u266a Finish \u266a", "title": "La sombra", "author": "P\u00edo Baroja"}
