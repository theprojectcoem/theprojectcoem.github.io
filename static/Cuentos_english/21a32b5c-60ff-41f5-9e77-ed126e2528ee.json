Could they bring the dead back to life? He asked Nasrudin. \"Of course\", replied the Imam. The Quran describes many cases. Then the mule said, \"I'm willing to prove that anyone can perform similar miracles. Do you dare to suggest that you too can raise the dead? \"Immad said in a cut-throat voice. \"Bring me a sword and I will prove it\", Nasrudin replied. A sword was brought and the crowd stretched out their necks to see the miracle. What are you gonna do? He asked the imam as Nasrudin pointed the leaf at him. I'm gonna tell you the head so we can all have a moment of peace, and then I'll put it back on you and you'll feel like new. \"There is no need for demonstration\", the Imam said nervously. I just wanted to prove you. I know perfectly well that you can perform miracles. FIN", "title": "Milagro", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
