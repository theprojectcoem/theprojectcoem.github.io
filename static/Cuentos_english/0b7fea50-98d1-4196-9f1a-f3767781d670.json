As he was being recognized, the neighbors came to embrace him, gave him clothes to cover his nakedness, congratulated him, patted his back. However, as the voice became more strained, the welcome was no longer as warm. A man who had occupied his vacant seat at the Post Office remarked harshly: \u201cYour return does not please me. You will claim your place and perhaps you will get it. Or I will stay on the street. Remember, I have five mouths to feed in my house. I prefer you go.\u201d The wife of Lazaro V\u00e9lez, who had married after a period of prudence, accused him: \u201cNow what? Maybe you're trying to condemn me for being a bgama? If you want to be happy, please disappear from my life.\u201d A squire, who had at that time inherited his four cows and six sheep, reproached him sharply: \u201cYou will not pretend to return what is now legally mine. Come, old man, and do not molest any more.\u201d L\u00e1zaro Velez decided not to continue. He began to retrace his steps, and as he walked down the road he was shedding the clothes that had been given him at the beginning. Finally, a old friend who recognized him and did not reproach him (perhaps because he had nothing to reproach him) approached him and asked, \u201cNow, where are you going?\u201d And Lazaro V\u00e9lez replied, \u201cTo recover my sudario.\u201d FIN", "title": "L\u00e1zaro", "author": "Mario Benedetti"}
