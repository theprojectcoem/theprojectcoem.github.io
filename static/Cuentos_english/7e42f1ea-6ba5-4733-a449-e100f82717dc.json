We walk, with our faces alert. The door was opened and for a moment the reflected light of the afternoon shone on Cespedes' shoulders. He greeted with a head nod and went to sign. Then we saw that he raised two ermined hands. He threw a sack and without looking at anyone he hurriedly left. Two days later, he appeared in the middle of the room, without giving us time to interrupt our conversation. He stepped up to the desktop and, taking the lancet, showed his hands inflamed by the flames. One day - and the teachers had gotten used to watching them - we saw them dead, rotting. He signed as best he could and went. Cespedes was like the wind: if we spoke to him we were blown away. He spent a week. We knew he had not given classes. Nobody knew where he was. He had not slept in his own house. In the early hours of Saturday morning, a student found him tangled in the weeds of the garden. He was dead, without hands. They had been shot from a gun. It was found that Cespedes had gone to seek the wingless angel who knew all secrets. Maybe Cespedes was on the verge of catching him on several occasions. If so, the angel had to escalate on successive occasions. Perhaps the angel first created a serpent, the second a hare, the third a beast of open mouths, and each time he plunged into his own creations tearing the hands of Cesper until he, in pain, had to let go. Perhaps the last time C\u00e9spedes pleaded and did not yield; and the wingless angel returned humbled to his kingdom, with human hands fastened forever to his celestial shoulders. Come to find out!
