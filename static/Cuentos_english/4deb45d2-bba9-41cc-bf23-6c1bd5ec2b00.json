At the end of a Sunday performance in a village, our man came to execute his favorite luck he counted on to favor the local public and thus ensure the good financial success of that season. In addition to his remarkable skills, let's just say, he had unusual resistance to discomfort and misery. Yet, at that time, he feared that they would recommend the usual inconveniences: the quarrels with the innkeeper, the kidnapping of his claw, the weather and again the painful and sad pilgrimage. The act he was about to perform was to get into a sack, whose mouth was tightly tied by the most suspicious spectators. After a few minutes, the sack was empty. At his invitation, two strong mocetons fitted with harsh ropes were mounted on the board. He entered the sack and soon felt the pull and tighten of the ties over his head. In the darkness he was in, he was overcome by a strong desire to escape the uncomfortable realities of his life. In such a strange disposition of spirit he closed his eyes and set out to disappear. Moments later it was found - no surprise to anyone - that the sack was empty and the ligaments remained intact. What did produce some astonishment was that the funambular did not reappear during the performance. After a time of vain waiting, the audience realized that the show was over and went home. But our circusman was never again beaten by the people. And the funny thing about the case was that no one at the inn had claimed his briefcase. After a few days, he completely forgot about the event. Who would care about a drifter! FIN", "title": "El vagabundo", "author": "Julio Torri"}
