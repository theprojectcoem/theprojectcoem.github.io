The war was brief. The lunatics, the softest beings, did not resist. No coffee discussions, no extraordinary editions of The Unnoticeable Shade, they were ruled by the terrestrials. The first is the fact that the European Union has not yet been able to achieve its objectives. France started such an imitation, as you'll guess. Everyone was given to the opaque and silent elegance. The thieves were in high demand in society, and the dying said excellent phrases. Even the ladies talked intricately, and the regulations of police and good government were written in such elaborate and subtle style that they were incomprehensible in every way even to the most illustrious criminals. Literati lived in the seventh realm of vague innuendo, of tortured imagery. Critics announced Mallarm\u00e9's return, but soon they were out of their misery.
