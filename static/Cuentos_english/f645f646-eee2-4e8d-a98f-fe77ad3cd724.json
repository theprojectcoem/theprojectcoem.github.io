He said, \"Thaddeus, I'm going to kill you. - Bromeas, Euphemia - laughed the unhappy. - When did I joke? - Never, it is true. - Why should I joke now and rightly on such a serious matter? - How are you going to kill me? - he kept laughing Thaddeus Smithson. - I don't know yet.

Or I'll have you roll down the stairs, use it when you're asleep to crush your skull with a silver candlestick, plug a power cord into the bathtub. We'll see. Mr. Smithson realized that his wife wasn't kidding. He lost sleep and appetite. He got heart disease, nervous breakdown and headache. Six months later, he passed away. Euphemia Smithson, who was a godly woman, thanked God for saving her from being a murderer. FIN", "title": "Cuento de horror", "author": "Marco Denevi"}
