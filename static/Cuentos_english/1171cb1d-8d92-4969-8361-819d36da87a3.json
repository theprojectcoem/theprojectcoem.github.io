The bat was originally as we know it today, and was called biguidibela (biguidi = butterfly and bella = meat; the name came to mean something like naked butterfly). On a very cold day, he went up to heaven and asked the Creator for feathers, as he had seen in other flying animals. But the Creator had no feathers, so he advised him to go back to the ground and ask for a feather from each bird. And so did the bat, yes, only resorting to birds with more prominent, more colorful feathers. By the time he finished his journey, the bat had made a large number of feathers wrapping his body. Aware of her beauty, she flew and flew proudly to show her to all the birds, who stopped their flight to admire her. He waved his wings now feathered, fluttering happily and with a certain air of preeminence. Once, as an echo of his flight, he created the rainbow. It was all beauty. But it was so much his pride that his pride turned him into an increasingly offensive being to the other birds. With his constant talk, he made those around him feel small, regardless of their qualities. Even the hummingbird was reproached for not owning a tenth of its beauty. When the Creator saw that the bat was not content to enjoy its new feathers but used them to humiliate others, he asked him to ascend to heaven, where he also paved and flew happily. He fluttered and fluttered as his feathers fell off one by one, revealing himself again as naked as at first. All day long it rained feathers from the sky, and since then our bat has remained naked, retreating to live in caves and forgetting his sense of sight so as not to have to remember all the colors he once had and lost.
