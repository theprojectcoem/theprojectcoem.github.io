He says he's keeping this to the horse-drawn carriage director, according to my role as interpreter. It's not possible, it's already sold. \"You lie, I'm not sold\", the horse said in our tongue. What did he say? The buyer asked. \"It doesn't matter\", said the director. Sometimes it would go away. Either this or none of them, the American stubbornly. He's a beautiful horse and he can talk. The head of the stable took me apart. I can't sell this one, because it's not a horse. What is it then? Two secret service agents from before the Revolution, dressed as horses. Whenever our general wanted to ride a horse, he would ride them, that is, him. Personal protection. And what are you doing here yet? They're hiding. You see, now, after the Revolution, the Secret Service agents don't have easy lives. Meanwhile the horse-not-horse had approached us. Don't be a jerk, he told the director. For us, it's the only chance to get to America. Does this horse speak Romanian too? The American asked, approaching our group. No, only in Polish. Why do you ask? I am a representative of an organisation that helps Eastern European countries financially. This horse will be sent to Romania as a breeding stallion to improve the breed. Then, thank you very much, the horse said and walked away. What did he say? The American asked me. I lied to him. After all, it's our business.
