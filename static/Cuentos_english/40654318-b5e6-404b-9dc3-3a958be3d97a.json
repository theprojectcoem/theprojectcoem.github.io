And he went and found a shepherd; and coming to him, he began to waver in his tail, having his hand raised. The shepherd, who saw him coming, was troubled by his presence and began to feed him some of the cattle. But the lion refused to eat, and instead took the nailed thorn out of him. The shepherd understood what the lion wanted, and with a sharp blade he opened the tumor slowly, and pulled out the spine. The lion felt healthy, licked the shepherd's hand, sat beside him, and shortly afterward, already a good hand, left. A few years later the lion fell into a trap, and was put in the place of the beasts. The shepherd committed a crime, was arrested for justice and sentenced to be eaten by the wild beasts. Putting him in the amphitheater, they accidentally threw out that same lion, which went out to throw itself on him with great fury, but when he reached the shepherd, after finding him, he sat down beside him and defended him from the other beasts. Everyone was amazed at such a remarkable thing, and the shepherd, knowing the truth, gave them both liberty. Do not be ungrateful for what you receive. Instead, give thanks, and give back when the opportunity arises.", "title": "El le\u00f3n y el pastor", "author": "nan Esopo"}
