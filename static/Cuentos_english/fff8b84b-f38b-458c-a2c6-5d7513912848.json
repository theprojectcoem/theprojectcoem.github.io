A pariah was coming in front of him with a basket of meat from the slaughterhouse. The man trampled on his feet and collided with the sage Shankaracharya, a Brahmin who had just bathed in the Ganges. This one felt unclean upon contact with the pariah, and cried out: \"Beware, you have touched me! \"Lord, do not be hasty in your judgments\". I didn't touch you, you didn't touch me.
