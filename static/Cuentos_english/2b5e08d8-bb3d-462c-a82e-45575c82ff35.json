One had several cracks through which water escaped, so that at the end of the road it only kept half, while the other was perfect and kept its contents intact. This happened every day. The cracked vessel was very proud of its achievements as it was known to be suitable for the purposes for which it was created. But the poor cracked vessel was ashamed of her own imperfection and of not being able to carry out her task properly. So after two years, she told the waterman, \"I'm ashamed and I want to apologize to you because because of my cracks you only get half the price you should get for your work. The waterman said, \"When we get home, I want you to notice the beautiful flowers that grow along the way. So did the stove, and indeed she saw many beautiful flowers along the way; but she kept feeling sad because in the end she kept only half the water from the beginning inside her. The waterman said to him, \"Did you notice that the flowers only grow on your side of the road?\" I wanted to take the good out of your cracks and plant flower seeds. You've watered them every day and for two years I've been able to collect them. If you weren't exactly who you are, with your abilities and limitations, it wouldn't have been possible to create that beauty. We are all cracked vessels somewhere, but there is always the possibility of exploiting cracks to get good results.", "title": "Cuento de las dos vasijas", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
