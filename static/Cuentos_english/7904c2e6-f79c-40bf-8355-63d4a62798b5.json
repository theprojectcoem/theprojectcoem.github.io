What he didn\u2019t tell him was that Aquiles, feeling he couldn\u2019t get closer, thought, \u201cIf Hector was a turtle!\u201d Well, in my argument against the movement I have given it that wish. Only to Him does nothing serve: every time it comes to the point where the turtle was, it has already come and so on infinitely. Meliso: Your argument is valid only if we strip him of his robes. At some points in the space the Time Disguise. I told you about the past\u2014the fame of the light feet of Aquiles and the slow feet of the turtle\u2014, the present\u2014the will both have to run\u2014 and the future\u2014the goal they expect at the end of the race. They and the turtle, psychologically, last. They do not last, mathematically, the infinite points at which a line can be divided. Your argument, to be logical, should deviate from the temporal images you have framed it in. Only then would your argument not hold. I mean, it's too obvious, no one would remember it.
