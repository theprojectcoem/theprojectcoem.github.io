And the king called him, and when he had him before him, he said, What mightst thou do? \"Many, Your Majesty\", he replied. For example, I can stay underground for months or even years. - Could you be buried for ten years and still live after? - asked the monarch. - No doubt, Your Majesty - said the fachir. - If so, when you are dug up, you will receive the purest diamond in the kingdom. He proceeded to bury the fakir. A moat was prepared several metres deep and a lead urn was disposed of. The fachir, before being buried, spread by talking about his spiritual and moral qualities that made his self-control and power possible. Everyone was convinced of his holiness. He was then put in the urn and buried. For ten years there were guards watching the moat. No one held the slightest hope that the Faquir would survive the test. The time agreed upon has passed. The whole court went to the grave of the faquir, with the certainty that, despite his holiness and power, he would have died and the corpse would be only a set of rotting bones. They pulled the urn out, opened it and found the faquir in a state of catalepsy. Little by little the man came back to life, took several deep breaths, opened his eyes, jumped and his first words were: \"By God, where is the diamond?\" FIN", "title": "Diez a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
