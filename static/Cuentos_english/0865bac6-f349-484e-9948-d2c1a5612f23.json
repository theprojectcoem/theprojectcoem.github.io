The beef, smarter than the bamboo, immediately began to complain, shouting that his testicles were hurting, that he was in great pain, and that he was asking for relief. He shouted so loudly that the guard ran, armed with a sharp sword, and unleashed both objects of his pain. The peul suffered greatly the rest of the night, but deep down he was glad he had saved his head. Next to her, the bamboo was sleeping deeply. In the morning the king called them and announced that they were free. His punishment had been lifted. The peul threw himself into a series of reproaches and lamentations: \"The bamboo has saved my life\", he cried, \"and I have lost my testicles!\" \"You must never read page five before page four\", the king told him.
