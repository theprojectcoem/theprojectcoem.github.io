The embroiderer, as she was very young, began to search everywhere for a perfect white rose, to embroider her own in the image and likeness of this one. But it happened that some roses were less beautiful than he had thought, and some were not as white as they should be. She spent days and days, hours crying, to find the rose she could imitate in silk, and, as remote countries never cease to be plagued with death, she well knew that, according to the laws of stories like this, they could not let her go unless she bore the white rose. Finally, in the absence of a better remedy, he recalled the white rose they had demanded. After he embroidered it, he compared it with the real ones that are in the roses. It turned out that all the white roses were exactly the same as the one he had engraved, that each one was exactly the same. So she took her work to the palace and it is to be imagined that she would marry the Prince. In the fantasy in which it is written, this fantasy has no morality. Exactly, because in the golden age, fairy tales had no morality. FIN", "title": "F\u00e1bula", "author": "Fernando Pessoa"}
