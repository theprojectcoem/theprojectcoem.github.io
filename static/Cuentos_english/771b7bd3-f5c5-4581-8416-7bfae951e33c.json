The candidates were first taken through the market to a room where they were invited to write down, on a big sheet of paper, everything they had observed. Some of the staff then collected those sheets and distributed others on which I had to make more observations. This was repeated several times and at last only those who had managed to fill a certain number of sheets with their observations were allowed to publish their observations publicly. The situation improved somewhat as a result of this, but it was still far from satisfactory. The government then organized new exams only for those who had already passed the first ones. They were returned with a single large leaf and asked to re-state their observations on that leaf. Then they collected all the leaves and distributed others, half as large, so that they also did the same. This operation was repeated several times, with smaller sheets, and finally only the public writing exercise was authorised to write to those who managed to sum up the maximum number of observations in the minimum number of lines.
