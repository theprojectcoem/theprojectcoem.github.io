A boy disappeared after a riot; it was said that the Indians had stolen him. Their parents looked for him in vain; but in the course of the years, a soldier from the land within told them of an Indian with celestial eyes who might well be their son. They finally found him (the chronicle has lost the circumstances and I don't want to invent what I don't know) and they believed to recognize him. The man, exhausted by the desert and the barbarity of life, had already forgotten the words of his native language, but he drove, indifferent and hesitant, to his home. There he stayed, perhaps because the others had stayed. He looked at the door, as if he didn't understand it. Soon he lowered his head, grumbled, walked through the mud and the two long courtyards and sat down in the kitchen. Without hesitation, he dropped his arm into the encrusted bell and pulled out the tin axe he had hidden there when he was a boy. His eyes glowed with joy and his parents wept because they had found their son. Perhaps there were others, but the Indian could not live within the walls, and one day he went to seek his wilderness. I would like to know what it felt like in that moment of vertigo when the past and the present were confused; I would like to know whether the lost son redeemed himself and died in that ecstasy or whether he was able to recognize, even as a creature or a dog, his parents and the house.
