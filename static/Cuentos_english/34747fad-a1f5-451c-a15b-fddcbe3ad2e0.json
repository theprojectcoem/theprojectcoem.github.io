Such is the case of an unbelieving character who was listening to a yogis who said, \"I can tell you that the mantra has the power to lead you to Being. The unbeliever replied, \"This is unfounded. How can the repetition of a word lead us to Being? That's like saying that if we repeat pan, bread, bread, the bread would come true and it would manifest. The yogi looked at the unbeliever and shouted, \"Sit right now, shameless. The unbeliever became filled with rage. His uncontrollable anger was so great that he began to tremble, and he cried out in his rage, \"How dare you speak to me like this?\" And you call yourself a holy man and you insult others? Then, with great affection and tenderness, the yogis said to him: \"I'm so sorry I offended you. But, tell me, how do you feel right now? - I feel offended! And the Yogi declared, \"You've got a bad feeling with one insulting word. Look at the enormous effect it has had on you. If this is so, why isn't the word that designates the Being going to have the power to transform you? FIN", "title": "El incr\u00e9dulo", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
