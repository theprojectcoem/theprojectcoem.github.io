The one who killed her gave her 20 stab wounds, which turned her into a stake. I screamed. The guards have arrived. And they sent and opened the door in the name of the law; and the same murderer opened it to us, and I pointed to the guards, saying, This is the one. The guards handcuffed him, and we entered the crime room. The room was empty, without a blood stain. There was no trace of anything in the house and, furthermore, he had not had time for any careful concealment. I was leaving, when I looked at the crime room for the last time, and I saw that on the floor of the mirror of the moon closet was the dead woman, lying like in the photograph of all the events, showing the newlyweds the links with death... Look, the killer threw her in the mirror, into the afterlife. FIN", "title": "Yo vi matar a aquella mujer", "author": "Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de la Serna"}
