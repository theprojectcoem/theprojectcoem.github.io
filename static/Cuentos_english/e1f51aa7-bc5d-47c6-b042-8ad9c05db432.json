Every morning, the mother walks the child to the new language school. When he picks him up in the afternoon and they come home, they find the father. He has finished his work, but then the couple begins the tasks of political exile: publications, flyers, posters, meetings with other exiles. The child attends all or goes with both at night, absorbed in discovering the faces and names of political prisoners, only seen on complaint posters. One night she hears the parents in a different conversation: she has to start a job and the schedule will prevent her from taking the child to school; the father can't either. The child intervenes: he goes alone. When parents doubt, he deposits before them the argument of a face and a name that the country has transmitted to him as one of the keys to exile: he knows to go, because the school, even if it has to bend three streets, is facing the tenth cartel that calls for Raul Sendic's freedom, to count from the house. And he wins. Every morning, the father repairs the broken signs on the new Thumbs up itinerary. Since prison, Sendic takes a child to school every day.
