But he had an important commitment and he was headed straight ahead, against the rain and the storm. He met an old man who said, \"Good morning! Where are you going, good man, in such a hurry? \"To Biella\", said the peasant without stopping. You could at least say, \"God willing\". The farmer stopped and said to the old man, 'If God wills, I will go to Biella; but if God wills not, I must go likewise.' Now, that old man was the Lord. Then you'll go to Biella in seven years, he told her. In the meantime, jump into that swamp and stay there. And the farmer suddenly turned into a frog, jumped and stayed in the swamp. It's been seven years. The peasant came out of the swamp, turned into a man, put his hat on his head, and resumed his march. A few steps later, he met the old man again. Where are you going, good man? - To the White. You could say, \"God willing\". If God wills, fine; if not, I know what the deal is, and I know how to get to that swamp alone. And there was no way to get him another answer. FIN Italian name unknown", "title": "Los bielleses, gente dura", "author": "nan An\u00f3nimo"}
